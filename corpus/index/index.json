      "Fe-X An estimated 16 million Americans have some degree of iron overload, either inherited (hemochromatosis) or acquired. Hereditary hemochromatosis (primary iron overload) is found more commonly in Northern Europeans, and some Southern Europeans. Secondary iron overload is acquired through the administration of recurrent blood transfusions (often for patients with thalassemia or sickle cell anemia); it is also possible to take too much oral supplementation. Iron is a free radical former, and excess iron can be toxic. Early symptoms of iron poisoning may include stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Excess iron is deposited mainly in the liver, heart, and endocrine organs. Excess iron in the liver can result in chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. In the heart muscle, it can lead to heart failure and irregular heart rhythms. Damage to the pancreas can lead to elevated blood glucose levels and \"bronze\" diabetes. Hypothyroidism and hypogonadism can result in fatigue, hair loss, infertility, and decreased libido. Joint involvement leads to arthritis. Iron deposits can accelerate neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Medical treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis consists of decreasing iron by the regular removal of blood from the body. The condition is generally monitored by serum ferritin or transferrin levels, but there is a better test. The gold standard for iron overload is a percent of iron saturation over 50 percent and this can also be true for hemochromatosis. Multiply the total serum iron by 100 and dividing the result by the total iron binding capacity (TIBC). If the value is greater than 50%, iron overload is present. Fe-X contains inositol hexaphosphate, which studies have shown to be effective at removing iron8,9,10. Be aware that it also chelates other minerals, so an iron-free multimineral needs to be taken with this product. It contains zinc, which can inhibit iron bioavailability1,2,3,4. It has molybdenum which, interestingly enough, offsets iron overload as well as benefiting anemia patients7,8. This, because of its relationship with copper. Cilantro, along with its chelating ability has been shown to protect against liver ischemia and cell damage11,12. During a clinical trial,18 out of 25 completed the six-week study using Fe-X and an iron free multiple mineral formula. The Fe-X with the iron fee multiple mineral formula was over 90 percent effective in lowering serum iron and percent of saturation. Only one of the 18 patients who completed the study was diagnosed with hemochromatosis. If the percent of saturation does not come down below 50 after 45 days on the program, the patient should be referred for gene testing to identify hemochromatosis (two or three gene positive). It is frequently inherited and is silent killer therefore, all the 1st degree relatives should be tested to rule out hemochromatosis. The treatment period for using Fe-X for secondary iron overload is 45 days. In hereditary hemochromatosis, the treatment may need to be ongoing. The medical treatment is to remove blood, thus reducing iron levels. Fe-X may reduce the need for this procedure. The need for testing percent iron saturation will be ongoing, as is the supplementation. Fe-X Description: One serving (2 capsules) contains 50 mg of Zinc Picolinate and a 450 mg proprietary blend of Molybdenum Citrate, Inositol Hexaphosphate (IP6) and cilantro. Recommendations: 2 to 3 capsules, two times per day for 45 days or as otherwise directed by a health care professional. The iron free mineral formula should be used through the entire forty-five day program. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration have not evaluated statements made herein.

      "Lithium Orotate Description: Each capsule contains 44 milligrams of U.S. manufactured fully reacted Nieper lithium orotate providing 4 milligrams of elemental lithium per capsule. Orotate is (orotic acid – vitamin B-13) is a natural substance found in the body and in many foods in our food chain. Lithium Orotate should not be confused with Lithium Carbonate a pharmaceutical agent administered in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is often administered at 300 mg tid and this provides 56.8 mgs of elemental lithium per dose with the tid dose being 170.4 mgs of elemental lithium per day. This high level requires frequent monitoring via serum testing and patient examination. According to the literature, levels below 20 mg per day are quite safe and therapeutic when Nieper U.S. manufactured orotates are used. Clinical Considerations Associated With Fully Reacted U.S. Manufactured Lithium Orotate: Provides effective results with gout and urate kidney stones (Javor, Int Urol Nephrol and Kvinsedal, Mineral Elec- trolyte Metabolism). Known to increase alkalinity in cells, blood, saliva, and urine (Kobayashi and Associates. Plugers Arch) making it excellent adjunctive support for dysdinsulism and other acidic problems. Increases neutrophils and help to prevent viral replication with immune compromised patients (Ballin and Associates, (BR Journal of Hemotology). Known to reduce blood pressure by altering sodium to potassium ratio and help to reduce stress, and sleep disorders related to stress (Price and Henninger, New England Journal of Medicine). Increases nitric oxide and should be considered with male erection problems (Bagetta and Associates, Bio-chem Biophys Res Common). Excellent adjunctive support with violent and irritable patients (Schauzer and Shrestha, Trace Element Res). Excellent adjunctive support to reduce T-4 and increase TSH for patients with thy-roid hyperfunction, Jacobs and Associates (Laboratory Test Handbook, 4th Edition). There are a myriad of literature citations indicating the use of lithium for Bi-Polar Depression, Depression, Unipolar Depression and Manic De-pression, Through clinician investigation, we have also found it to be extremely effective as adjunctive treatment with alcoholism, fibromyalgia, sympathetic dominance, headaches, menses cramps, animals on low lithium diets and enuresis.

      "Lymphatic Drainage � ZnrPY . �n terna t1onal® \"Our Mission is Excellence in Nutrition\" DESCRIPTION: Lymphatic Drainage was developed by Jeffrey Sorna, DiHOM and Harry O Eidenier, Ill. Each four-ounce bottle contains a proprietary blend of distilled water, colloidal silver, zinc, boron and electromagnetic isodes. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: In general, the lymphatic system is part of our immune system that assists our various other systems to protect against disease, inflammation, autoimmune problems, and infections. Segments of the lymphatic system include lymph nodes, plasma cells, the spleen and appendix, gastrointestinal mammalian cells, bone marrow and immunoglobulins. All these areas make the lymph flow imperative to good health. According to Moore and Bertram, Lymphatic System Flows, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, England, the supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is performed by the blood and involves a net linkage of fluid outward at the capillary level. A principal function of the lymphatic system is to gather this fluid and return it to the blood. Lymphatic congestion interrupts this function and results in swelling of the tissues and in most case lymph edema with resulting inflammation and diminished immune system function. It follows that with lymph congestion or what is commonly called lymph edema or restricted lymph drainage, is the restricted flow/transport of immune cells and antigens. Therefore, the result is lack of or reduced adaptive immunity. Transport along the lymphatic flow stream delivers critical nutrients to lymph nodes and improves active cell movement. Also, according to Moore and Bertram, the deadliest forms of cancer spread because metastatic cells separate from primary tumors and are easily taken into the lymphatic system where the immune system can then eliminate them. With lymphatic congestion/lack of drainage, this ability is significantly reduced or lost. Improving lymphatic flow/drainage should be considered with all autoimmune problems, free radical problems, infection, inflammation and other forms of disease. RECOMMENDATIONS: One teaspoon, twice a day or as directed by a healthcare professional. AVAi LABI LITY: Lymphatic Drainage is available in four-ounce bottle (24 servings per bottle).",

      "MAGNESIUM GLYCEROPHOSPHATE COMPLEX Description: Each four-capsule serving provides 400 milligrams of magnesium glycerophosphate (100 milligrams of elemental magnesium per capsule) and 10 milligrams of L-Taurine. Clinical Considerations: Magnesium glycerophosphate is a fat-soluble salt that has the lowest laxative effect of the various magnesium salts. Twenty patients were given 400 mg of magnesium in different salts and a placebo for 28 days. The salts caused diarrhea at a rate from 96% for sulfate, 32% for lactate and 20 percent for phosphate, the rate for magnesium glycerophosphate was just 7% the same as the placebo (Driessens and Associates, Formulas for Daily Oral Magnesium Supplementation and Some of Their Side Effects, Magnesium Bulletin. Conclusion – If your patient requires magnesium supplementation and most forms cause diarrhea at low dose then Magnesium Glycerophosphate Complex should be the first form considered. Calcium is needed for muscle contraction and magnesium is needed for muscle relaxation and the glycerophosphate form was found to be the most effective for relaxation and spasticity (contraction of the muscle causing stiffness and tightness), Rude and Associates, Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins. With muscle spasticity, tightness or stiffness, Magnesium Glycerophosphate should be the first form considered. From the early to the late 1980s, over 10,000 patients were followed via the Bio-chemical Blood Biopsy, Harry O. Eidenier, Jr. and Associates. This long-term study indicated that when the serum magnesium was < 2.2 or the RBC magnesium was < 6.0 magnesium need was certain. According to the peer literature there are a myriad of studies supported by clinical results that indicate that magnesium insufficiency is probable with numbness or tingling in the extremities, seizures, personality disorders, abnormal heart rhythm, fatigue, weakness, high blood pressure, all cardiac conditions, virus, diabetes and other glycemic problems, loss of appetite and a myriad of less common conditions. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ACCORDING TO MOST RECENT PEER REVIEWED STUDIES, MORE THAN 75% OF THE U.S. POPULATION IS MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCT. Since the percent so high and the rate of diarrhea is high with most magnesium salts, there is good reason to make Magnesium Glycerophosphate Complex your first choice with magnesium need. An article that is too long to be attached to this literature is Predicting and Testing Bioavailability of Magnesium Supplements, Blancquaert and Associates, Nutrition, and is available on the internet for review. Recommendations: Begin with four tablets at bedtime and increase by one tablet every other evening to bowel tolerance. When the patient reaches bowel tolerance (loose stool or diarrhea in the a.m.), then reduce the nest lowest level and hold until loose stools or diarrhea occur again. Follow this procedure until the long-term dose is identified. Magnesium (irrespective of the carrier) should always be dosed at bedtime when the chance of fat being present in the G.I. is at its lowest (magnesium will bind with fat and reduce its absorption). Cautions: Magnesium supplementation is generally contraindicated with renal dysfunction and if used with renal dysfunction should only be used at the direction of a licensed health care provider.

      "Expanded Clinical Notes: Magnesium Orotate 1250 Magnesium orotate (Nieper orotate – originally called vitamin B-13), helps to support the heart’s ability to endure and recover from chronic and acute stress through the maintenance of normal glycogen stores, protein synthesis, ATP levels and contractile function. The U.S. manufactured Nieper magnesium orotate produced by Zorex International is fully reacted, unlike most orotates which are food-grade mixtures of orotic acid with inorganic magnesium salts, which may cause mild liver toxicity. Magnesium orotate (Nieper form as produced by Zorex International) also acts as a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleo- tides which is a building block for your DNA code and for RNA. Dr. Nieper was, in some re- searcher’s minds, a “space cadet” because of his interest in theoretical physics; in fact his views on gravity and other forms of physics were viewed by many as nonsense. However, his true accomplishments were the outcome of his clinical work. With the help of various col- leagues he developed orotic acid as a mineral transporter. Nieper insisted that with most mineral carriers the carrier becomes trapped in the inner cell membrane and the mineral is not properly released. The orotates; however, pass through both the outer and inner cell membrane into the interior of the cell and only become metabolized once they reach the membranes of structures within the cell, thus leaving the ion in or near these structures and allowing a lower level of the elemental mineral to be used. While these explanations are soundly plausible, there is no peer literature to support his theories. However, as stated in the literature on the reverse side mail, there is peer reviewed literature supporting the use of his magnesium orotate with recovery from heart attacks, recovery from heart surgery, im- proved athletic performance, cardiovascular disease and elevated cholesterol. Nieper also used (as we did when it was previously available) magnesium orotate for atherosclerosis, renal failure from diabetes and/or hypertension, blood clots and although not previously mentioned, M.S. One last thought on the Nieper magnesium orotate – Ultimately the value of Nieper’s work on mineral transporters does not depend upon whether his theories and explanations were valid, or upon whether his observations were biased, or upon the rulings of the government or the medical cartel. It depends only upon whether the transporters work when you use them. Many users, past and present, are quite convinced that their lives or health and lives of their patients have been rescued by these supplements and this alone justifies their exist- ence in the healing arts.

      "Magnesium Taurinate Description: Each capsule contains 1000 mg of Magnesium Taurinate yielding 80 mg of elemental magnesium, 750 mg of taurine and 14.4 mg potassium citrate. Clinical Considerations: Magnesium, according to the peer literature (Magnesium in Prevention and Therapy, Grober and Associates, Nu-trients, MDPI), is required for energy production, enzyme activation, as a calcium antagonist, as support for the cardiovascular system, support for diabetes and as a nutrient to be used with hypertension). Taurine (Therapeutic Effect of Taurine in Congestive Heart Failure, Azuma and Associates, Clinical Cardiology), was shown to be effec-tive in a double-blind, placebo controlled study, to decrease the pre-ejection period significantly. Also, the sum-mary indicated that the addition of taurine is safe and effective for patients with congestive heart failure. Other literature citations have indicated that taurine is the major transport nutrient that allows magnesium to be incorpo-rated into the RBC. Taurine is also known to help with some cases of tinnitus, in the prevention of seizures and to thin bile. Potassium citrate is also a known cofactor to magnesium transport and retention (Mechanism of Hypokalemia in Magnesium Deficiency, Choo-Long and Associates, Journal of the American Society of Nephology). According to the CDC more than 50 percent of the U.S. population is deficient in both magnesium and potassium. The CDC also indicates that vegans are at high risk for taurine deficiency. According to Angaral and Associates (Experimental Eye), Magnesium Taurinate has a positive effect on the de-lay and progression of cataracts. Silver Bullet: When magnesium is found < 6.0 in the RBC and > in a mineral (hair, RBC or urine) analysis, the reason is generally a taurine deficiency (inability to transport the magnesium into the RBC).

      "MELATONIN Description: Each capsule contains 10 milligrams of melatonin. Clinical Considerations: According to Muchit and Associates, Eurasian Journal of Medicine, and Dr Aziz Sancar (Nobel Prize winner), melatonin, is a hormone secreted from the pineal gland at night. Melatonin plays roles in regulating sleep- wake cycles (most of us knew that), but also plays a role in pubertal development, and seasonal adaption (your patient who complains of an exacerbation of symptoms when the seasons change or when the barometric pressure changes from high [good weather] to low [bad weather) or back from low to high). These patients are also frequently thiamine deficient (B6/B1 from Zorex International) and are also patient with digestive problems. Melatonin will often help them overcome their symptoms while the nexus is identified and treated. In their research Michit and Associates also indicates that melatonin was also anti-depressive, anti- neophobic (fearful of new things), locomotor activity-regulation (control of spontaneous movement), neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and retinal protective. According to Fagard and Associates, University Department of Child Development, Rennes University, Rennes France (Advance in the Research of Melatonin in Autism Spectrum Disorders), melatonin supplementation was found to be helpful with many of their young patients with autism According of Frank Shallenberger, MD, HMD, Townsend Letter, High Dose Melatonin Therapy – An Ideal Adjuvant Anti-Cancer Therapy, list myriad of reasons for melatonin use with cancer and included the work of Mediavilla and Associates that indicated that melatonin had direct anti-neoplastic effects, decreased cell proliferation at low concentrations, and induction of apoptosis. Dr. Shallenberger’s article is excellent, and the total article should be reviewed. According to Pamela W. Smith, MD, MPH, Melatonin: More Than Just the HormoneThat Regulates Sleep, Townsend Letter, indicates that some of the signs of melatonin deficiency are fatigue, stress, increased risk of cancer, heart disease, and compromised immune function. According to Hardeland, Scientific World Journal, deficiency , and need for melatonin, is found with dementia, mood disorders, severe pain, cancer, and type 2 diabetes.

      "Contents: Reishi, Maitake, Shiitake and L-Carnitine Fumarate Since ancient times, mushrooms have been used as food sources and as treatment of diseases in traditional medicine. Some mushrooms have significant bioactive compounds that can exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects. Mushrooms have therapeutic effects in the prevention and treatment of many disorders, such as free radical pathologies, cardiovascular imbalances or neurodegenerative imbalances. Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum), shiitake (Lentinela edodes), maitake (Grifola frondosa) are three of the most widely used and studied mushrooms. The Ergothioneine content in mushrooms has shown beneficial effects on the functioning of certain genes that transport Carnitine into the cell to support the Electron Transport Chain to produce energy. Carnitine itself has been shown to have protective effects on many systems in the body. Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) The biologically active compounds in Reishi have been reported to possess hepatoprotective, antihypertensive, hypocholesterolemic, antihistaminic effects and antioxidant, antitumor, immunomodulatory, and antiangiogenic activities. Reference Maitake (Grifola frondose) Maitake has shown significant antitumor, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and other activities. Reference Shiitake (Lentinela edodes) Shiitake has antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer/antitumor, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, anticholesterol, antioxidative, antiaging, hepatoprotective, and immunomodulatory ingredients. Reference L-Carnitine Fumarate L-Carnitine is involved in fatty acid metabolism. L-Carnitine can be found in many foods, but red meats, such as beef and lamb, fish, poultry and milk are the best choices for adding carnitine into the diet. L-carnitine transports the chains of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, thus allowing the cells to break down fat and get energy from the stored fat reserves. Carnitine is important for overall health. Including: • Supports Sperm Quality and Quantity “supplementation with carnitine improves sperm quality and/or quantity in testes of mice exposed to physical insults”, Reference • Supports Energy Production Carnitine helps in the production of energy and the metabolism of fatty acids. Deficits in carnitine transporters occur as a result of genetic mutations or in combination with other illnesses such like hepatic or renal disease. Reference",
      "• Supports Endocrine Function Carnitine deficiency can cause diseases such as endocrine imbalances, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, malnutrition, aging, sepsis, and cirrhosis due to abnormalities in carnitine regulation. Reference • Benefits Muscle and Neurological Health Hypotonia, muscle weakness, motor skills, and wasting are all improved l-carnitine (LC) Reference Carnitine has been show to impair the progression of most neurological disorders. Reference • Supports Cardiovascular Disease Improvement in myocardial functionality and metabolism in ischemic heart disease patients, as well as athletic performance in individuals with angina pectoris has been seen. Reference • Supports Liver Health “L-carnitine may have therapeutic role in liver diseases including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis.” Reference • Helps reduce Inflammation “L-carnitine supplementation was associated with lowering of CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and MDA, and increasing SOD levels, but did not affect other inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers.” Reference • Helps Balance Blood Fats supplementation with L-carnitine has been shown to reduce cholesterol, triglycerides, and increase HDL levels. Reference Ergothioneine and Carnitine Support the function Genetic Variants Genetic variants in the OCTN genes (SLC22A4/SLC22A5) can lead to imbalances in carnitine use in the body. The ergothioneine contained in the mushroom blends allows cells to respond to carnitine by activating the transporter that allows carnitine to enter the cell. Reference Genetic defects of fatty acid oxidation lead to fats that are released from the adipose tissue during fasting and reach the liver, skeletal muscle and heart where they can accumulate. In the liver, a defect in the carnitine cycle or in mitochondrial β-oxidation will result in steatosis and decreased production of ketones. If fatty acid oxidation is defective, fat cannot be utilized, glucose is consumed without regeneration via gluconeogenesis (due to inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase), ketones cannot be produced and there is a drop in glucose levels (hypoglycemia). The lack of usable supplies of energy will impair brain function. Reference Fats can go directly to the heart and skeletal muscle, where they can accumulate and impair organ/tissue function (cardiomyopathy/myopathy). Free fatty acids and long-chain acylcarnitines can alter the electrical activity of cardiac cells resulting in arrhythmia. Reference In certain diseases, the muscle fibers can also break down during sustained exercise resulting in myoglobinuria.",
      "Genetic variants in the OCTN gene can lead to Crohn’s disease Reference, Ulcerative Colitis and an inefficient processing of food (especially fats) into energy. This inefficiency can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and exercise intolerance. In the diagram below you can see the SLC22A4 enzyme which is a solute carrier for carnitine. If there are genetic variants present, the ability of carnitine to enter the cell is inhibited. Synergy of Ingredients: The ergothioneine contained in the mushroom extracts has been shown to support the function of the Carnitine transporter OCTN. Ergothioneine allows the transporter to function effectively to transport Carnitine into the cell and support mitochondrial function. Reference"

      "Expanded Clinical Notes: Niacinamide 500 Our decision to carry this product is based on the strong clinical feed-back we have received concerning the efficacy of niacinamide for patients suffering with the pain and swelling that accompanies both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, and the written information by William Kaufman, Ph.D., M.D., “The Use of Vitamin Therapy to Reverse Certain Concomitants of Aging”, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Vol III, #11, 11/55, 927-936; “Niacinamide: A Most Neglected Vitamin”, Journal of the International Academy of Preventive Medicine, Vol VIII, #1, 83, and Jonathan Wright, M.D., Nutrition and Healing, Vol I, #2, 10/94. Dr. Kaufman indicated that niacinamide should be dosed at 250-500 mgs, 6 to 12 times a day however, Dr. Wright indicated that 1000 mgs, 3 times a day was effective for the pain and swelling of arthritis. Dr. Wright noted in his report that he had been using niacinamide since 1973 and this supplement had benefited the vast majority of his patients. Dr. Kaufman indicated in his reports that although niacinamide does not possess analgesic or anti- inflammatory effects, joint pain was reduced and disappeared in, the majority of patients, and he also indicated that IN OVER SEVERAL THOUSAND PATIENT YEARS OF HIGH DOSE NIACINAMIDE THERAPY, NO ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED OR OBSERVED. Dr. Kaufman noted that the addition of other vitamins singly or in combination (other B vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, etc.), were helpful, along with a diet that provided adequate protein and calories; but did not affect the outcome of niacinamide in the control of the pain and swelling. In his report, Dr. Wright also suggested that other nutrients and diet were helpful but did not affect the outcome of niacinamide alone in the control of pain associated with arthritis.

      "Power Pill FORMULATED BY: DR J. DUNN At the heart of our cellular power is the Mitochondria. The mitochondria produce energy inside the cell from the nutrients you consume and absorb. Underfunctioning mitochondria may result in: • Fatigue • Low stamina • Exercise Intolerance • Low mood • Excessive appetite, especially for carbohydrates • Accelerated aging process • Risk of neurological imbalances • Free radical pathology • Heart imbalances In fact, mitochondria have been shown to be at the very root of our risk of cancer. Our mitochondria can be damaged by infections, stress, and trauma. In addition, our environment is so different than that of our ancestors and so much of our environment is detrimental to our mitochondria. They are incredibly vulnerable to toxins, chemicals, EMF’s, radiation, medications, heavy metals, pesticides, including glyphosates, and more. These are things our ancestors never encountered. As our Mitochondria get damaged, they have great difficulty recovering and, in some cases, can be permanently damaged. In fact, there is a black box warning on certain medications that they may do permanent damage to your DNA. This is through damage and destruction of mitochondria. In addition, you may have inherited certain genetic variants that add to the inability to process some of these substances which leads to further damage and faster aging. Certain nutrients have been shown to help restore mitochondrial function which can lead to increased energy, stamina and metabolism, and protection from various diseases. The trick here can be getting the right combination of nutrients without pushing other biochemical pathways in the wrong direction which happens with many mitochondrial nutrient support blends. The blend of nutrients in the “Power Pill” has been shown clinically to support mitochondria in a synergistic fashion without causing adverse reactions in other pathways. The patients who have been using this product now for months, swear by the increased energy and stamina, the need for fewer supplements, better sleep and just an “overall feeling of wellbeing at the cellular level”.

      "Ingredients: Alpha Lipoic Acid: supports the function of the Krebs cycle as well as providing antioxidant support for quenching free radicals that can damage mitochondria. Thiamin Mononitrate: This nutrient is critical in supporting glycolysis and feeding nutrients into the Krebs Cycle. It is depleted by alcohol and in short supply in our modern diet. Magnesium Taurinate: Magnesium in general supports the body in so many of the pathways of the body but particularly in the Citric Acid Cycle and energy production pathways. The Taurinate form helps transport Magnesium into the red blood cells for increased energy production. Riboflavin: This B Vitamin is a cofactor in the methylation pathway and can up regulate the production of energy in the Electron transport chain. It is often overlooked but can be critical for getting the energy production pathways humming. L-Carnitine Fumarate: The Fumarate form of Carnitine is the most beneficial form for supporting the Krebs cycle and the Electron transport Chain. With some genetic variants, they may need to add some mushroom blends as a source of Ergothioneine to support the entry of carnitine into the cell. This supports burning fats as a fuel to produce energy. CoQ10: CoQ 10 acts as the electron acceptor in the mitochondria. Without enough CoQ10, the entire production of ATP (energy) will grind to a halt and free radicals in the form of peroxynitrites and superoxides will begin to accumulate. This leads to faster aging, increased risk of free radical pathologies, DNA damage and inflammation. Note: • For those with issues in the Sulfur pathways-Consider adding Molybdenum to the program. • For those with issues in the Carnitine pathways, consider adding mushroom blends (Reishi, Maitake, Shiitake, Etc) to assist in transport of Carnitine into the cell.

      "PREGNENOLONE Each capsule contains 25 mg of natural Pregnenolone, sourced from U.S. grown Wild Mexican Yam. The gelatin capsule used for this product is Kosher certified. Pregnenolone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It is formed from cholesterol and is the precursor hormone to cortisol and DHEA as well as testosterone, progesterone and estrogens. Pregnenolone levels are much higher in the brain than in the peripheral tissues. Clinical Considerations: Pregnenolone should be considered with arthritis, depression, fatigue states, memory loss and moodiness. Though studies on Pregnenolone are few, animal and human studies have failed to reveal any major side effects of taking Pregnenolone, even at high doses. Large doses of Pregnenolone are usually not required. Occasionally acne and drowsiness are reported as temporary side effects of more than 100 mg per day. Recommendations: Pregnenolone should not be used during pregnancy or lactation. Consider 1 capsule bid. Availability: Pregnenolone is available in 90 capsule bottles. CONTINUED ON BACK The U.S. Food and Drug Administration have not evaluated statements made herein. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat or prevent disease.",
      "Pregnenolone Pregnenolone is a steroid precursor hormone produced principally in the adrenal glands, but also in the liver, skin, brain, testicles, ovaries, and retina of the eyes. Steroids are a large family of structurally similar biochemicals that have sex-determining, anti-inflammatory, and growth-regulatory roles. Indeed, pregnenolone is the grand precursor from which almost all of the other steroid hormones are made; including DHEA, progesterone, testosterone, the estrogens, and cortiso.. Despite its powerful metabolites, pregnenolone is acknowledged to be without significant side effects, with minimal or no anabolic, estrogenic or androgenic activity. Pregnenolone also operates as a powerful neurosteroid in the brain, modulating the transmission of messages from neuron to neuron and strongly influencing learning and memory processes.1,2 As with DHEA, pregnenolone levels natu- rally peak during youth and begin a long, slow decline with age. By the age of 75 our bodies produce 60% less pregne- nolone than the levels produced in our mid-thirties.3 For this reason pregnenolone is one of the biomarkers of aging. Like counting the rings of a tree, by measuring the level of pregnenolone at any given point of a person's life, it is often possible to make an educated guess as to his or her age. Some other hormones that decline with age are DHEA, estrogen, testosterone, and growth hormone.4 These are con- sidered biomarkers of aging as well. Since pregnenolone provides the initial raw material from which all the other steroid hormones are made, some of our other hormones will decline in a parallel fashion. While our youth-giving hormones are diminishing, loss of quality of life progressively settles in. We slowly begin to experience physical and mental decline; loss of energy, memory loss, visual and hearing impairment, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and sexual decline, just to name a few. Supplementing small amounts of these neurohormones may slow these age-related processes, improving one's quality of life by rejuvenating the body to more youthful functioning. The best known example of hormone replacement therapy is estrogen replacement for menopausal women to prevent heart disease, osteoporosis, vaginal discomfort and many other conditions of menopause. More recent studies have shown that replacing growth hormone in elderly individuals can also produce age-reversing changes, including in- creased lean muscle mass, reduced fat, stronger bones, and thicker skin. Human studies were conducted in the 1940's on factory workers to test the effect of pregnenolone on anti-fatigability5,6,7 and autoimmune disorders,8 including rheumatoid arthritis. The results were successful and improvements were noted. Even though pregnenolone was proving to be not only effective, but safe as well, it was discarded when Merck's newly introduced pharmaceutical agent, cortisone, was announced to be a cure-all for rheumatoid arthritis in 1949.9 Soon after cortisone and cortisol came into use, the synthetic steroid hormones dexamethasone, and later prednisone, was introduced. Remember that these steroids are hundreds of times more powerful than pregnenolone (or DHEA for that matter). Because they could be patented, it was more politically and economically advantageous for pharmaceutical companies to promote these drugs rather than pregnenolone. Additionally, these steroids were very fast acting com- pared to pregnenolone. Users and doctors preferred the quick fix. However, these steroidal compounds proved to have (and still do have) serious downsides, including compromising the immune system and inducing osteoporosis, among other serious complications.",
      "Pregnenolone Even though cortisone and cortisol are stress hormones which are natural to the body, they have historically been and continue to be administered in pharmacological doses rather than at physiological amounts natural to the body. The pharmacological levels at which cortisone and cortisol are generally administered give them a risk profile not unlike that of the synthetic hormones. Scientists have been studying the impact of hormones on learning and memory for many years. Dr. Eugene Roberts has been a leading figure in neurochemistry for more than half a century. He has been a primary figure in reviving interest in pregnenolone and DHEA as therapeutic agents. Regarding pregnenolone, Dr. Roberts has said, \"Of all the things that have been tested anywhere in the brain, this is by far the most potent.\"10 Although many substances have been found to help maintain healthy cognitive function, pregnenolone seems to have extraordinary activity in this regard.11 Various studies have found that pregnenolone supports motivation, the ability to acquire knowledge, and long-term memory.12 One study found pregnenolone to be one hundred times more effective for memory support than other memory-promoting steroids.13 Other studies have revealed pregnenolone's ability to maintain learning function even when used in exceptionally small amounts.14 One of the most remarkable properties of pregnenolone is its apparent ability to support certain aspects of memory when taken \"after the fact.\"15 This has been found to be true for DHEA also, but to a lesser degree. Thus, the use of pregnenolone may help recall of information encountered prior to ingestion. You may wake up in the morning, decide that you really want to embed information previously absorbed, and take some pregnenolone. A research group of industrial psychologists conducted studies in the 1940's to test pregnenolone on students and workers for the ability to enhance job performance.5-8 They found that the students/workers had a markedly improved ability to learn and remember difficult tasks. It is also amazing that pregnenolone not only enhanced job performance of the students/workers; but they additionally experienced heightened feelings of well-being. In the words of Dr .William Regelson, renowned oncologist, researcher and leading figure of the \"super hormone\" revolution puts it this way, \"... this super hormone [pregnenolone] has the ability to make us not only smarter but happier.\"16 The same research group performed a study on factory workers to see if pregnenolone could improve their work productivity. Productivity increased most notably in the workers whose situations were considered the most stressful; for example, the workers who got paid per piece and whose living depended on their productivity. Improvement was noted, but less so, in workers who got paid a fixed wage regardless of their productivity levels. Not only did pregne- nolone improve productivity for both groups, but the workers reported enhanced mood. The insidious disappearance of well-being is a common experience for many of us as we age. The onset of depres- sion and energy loss is so universal for older and elderly people that it is written off as part of the normal aging pro- cess and left unattended. This is particularly unfortunate since there is something that can be done. We know that neurohormones affect neurotransmitters and can have profound effects on mental function. Many sci- entists and physicians believe depression in older people may be due to deficiency in the hormones that were once circulating at youthful concentrations. Restoring youthful levels of pregnenolone and possibly other neurohormones may prevent or even reverse age-related depression.",
      "Pregnenolone In addition to a steady stream of anecdotal reports, there have been other experiments indicating pregnenolone's asso- ciation with elevated mood, increased energy, and alleviated or improved depression. If further studies solidify pregne- nolone's role, as well as the role of other neurosteroids, with regard to depression and other possible mood dysfunc- tions, it will further the natural hormone replacement revolution within the life extension arena and possibly bring about a total reformation in psychiatric medicine. Historically, pregnenolone has been used successfully for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as far back as the 1940's. This is an autoimmune disease which is more likely to occur with advancing age. It is characterized by painful joints and fatigue, among other symptoms. Studies were conducted to determine the effects of pregnenolone on other autoimmune disorders such as lupus and ankylosing spondylitis. While results with osteoarthritis were not apparent, probaby because inflammation is not as severe, Dr Roberts suggests that even here pregnenolone might be effective because of its ability to increase production of endogenous cortisone.3 It is believed by some physicians and scientists that pregnenolone may have use in various other areas, including high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, PMS, and immune dysfunction. Additionally, studies on the horizon will determine whether pregnenolone has the ability to help reverse paralysis for spinal cord injuries and more. References 1. Baulieu EE.

Clinical Considerations: Progesterone Cream should be considered for Menopause, Post Menopause, Amenorrhea, Breast tenderness, Hot flashes, PMS, Hypothyroidism, Osteoporosis and Andropause. Progesterone should be considered anytime it is determined the patient is estrogen dominant. Further Information and Literature on the use of Progesterone Cream can be found on the next page. Recommendations: The normal pre-menopausal pattern for progesterone secretion during the month is for the ovaries to produce progesterone in the second two weeks of the menstrual cycle (day 14 through 28, beginning at ovulation and ending around the beginning of men-ses). Little progesterone is produced during the following two weeks. Supplemental Progesterone Cream, if needed, should be considered during this period. Perimenopause is associated with reduced progesterone production. Progesterone Cream can be considered safely at two weeks on and two weeks off. This will normally help to reestablish normal menstrual cycles. Progesterone Cream should also be considered during post-menopause because progesterone is important as a regulator of pituitary/hypothalamus function and will often overcome the unopposed production of cortisol, prolactin and androgenic hormones. For mild symptoms use 1/2 pump two times a day. For severe symptoms use 1 full pump two times a day. Apply on thinnest area of skin (chest, throat, back of neck or inside arms with palms up) or otherwise directed by a health care professional.

      "Progesterone Cream (Micronized/Bio-Identical) According to Ray Peat, Ph.D., who is considered one of the world’s leading experts on natural progesterone therapy, “sixty years ago, progesterone was considered to be the main hormone produced by the ovaries since it was necessary for fertility and for maintaining a health pregnancy. It was called “pro-gestational hormone”, ad its name sometimes leads people to think that it isn’t needed when you do not want to get pregnant. In fact, it is the most protective hormone the body produces, and the large amounts that are produced during pregnancy result from the developing baby’s need for protection from the stressful environment. Normally, the brain contains a very high concentration of progesterone, reflecting its protective function for that important organ. The thymus gland, the key organ of our immune system, is also profoundly dependent on progesterone”. Another quote from one of Dr Peat’s summaries on natural progesterone “ Published experiments have shown that progesterone relieves anxiety, improves memory, protects brain cells and even prevents epileptic seizures. It promotes respiration and has been used to correct emphysema. In the circulatory sys-tem, it prevents bulging veins by increasing the tone of blood vessels and improves the efficiency of the heart. It reverses many of the signs of aging in the skin and promotes health bone growth”. C. Djerassi, The Making Of The Pill, Science. Djerassi indicated that until the middle 1920s it was assumed that progesterone’s biological activity was extremely specific and “any alteration of the molecule would diminish or abolish its activity”. This would discourage interest from big pharma who could not patent a natural substance. However, later the molecule was changed in order to allow big pharma to produce it. In Defense of Progesterone: A Review of the Literature, Lieberman and Curtis, Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. A meta-analysis of three studies involving 86.881 post-menopausal women reported that the use of natural progesterone was associated with significant lower risk of breast cancer compared with synthetic progestins. Anovulation and low levels of serum progesterone have been associated with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal women. Use of natural progesterone has been linked to lower rates of uterine and colon cancers and may also be useful in treating other cancers such as ovarian, melanoma, mesothelioma and prostate. Lieberman and Curtis concluded “Physicians should have no hesitation prescribing natural progesterone, as the evidence is clear that progesterone does not cause breast cancer. Indeed, progesterone is protective and preventative of breast cancer”. Unsuspecting Benzyl Alcohol Hypersensitivity, Grant and Associates, New England Journal of Medicine, When patients/clients indicate an allergy to progesterone, they are generally not aware of the presence of a toxic solvent such as benzyl alcohol. The Progesterone Cream produced by Zorex International contains no benzyl alcohol or other toxic substances. The ZRT Laboratory Blog, David Zava, Ph.D., Topical Progesterone, Not Synthetic Progestins or Oral Progesterone, Should be Considered as a Companion for Estradiol Replacement Therapy. This is a long article describing the value of natural topical progesterone. It is an extensive review of the literature on this subject and we encourage you to find it on the internet and read the factual information. Stephenson and Associates, Topical Progesterone Cream Does Not Increase Thrombotic and Inflammatory Factors in Post-Menopausal Women, Blood. Post-menopausal women have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and heart disease is the leading cause of death in post-menopausal American women. In this prospective blinded study the authors examined the short-term effect of topical progesterone cream on menopausal symptom relief in 30 healthy post-menopausal women; to determine the potential adverse effects of topical progesterone cream on hemostatic and inflammatory factors and cortisol levels. Subjects were randomized to receive topical progesterone cream or placebo for four weeks, followed by a four week wash out period. After the wash out period the subjects crossed over to either placebo cream or active cream for four weeks. From this study the authors conclude that administration of topical progesterone cream significantly relieves menopausal symptoms in post-menopausal women without adversely altering pro-thrombotic potential. The authors further concluded that the thrombotic complications observed with progesterone drug therapy do not occur with topical progesterone cream. This treatment should be seriously considered as an effective and safe alternative clinical therapy for women suffering from post- menopausal symptoms.

S.O.S. supports organ systems and glandular function involved with any and all stressful events. In most cases it is not considered a standalone adrenal, immune, or intestinal support, or stimulant. It is support for the synergistic organs involved with the stress the body is suffering with. Stress is handled by the adrenals but affects many organs of the body. This product was designed with the “Support System” in mind. Clinical Considerations: Clinical Conditions: During a 90-day clinical trial by Dino Kotsonis D.C, DACNB, the following conditions/problems were successfully treated with S.O.S. Topical Wounds (diabetic ulcers, insect bites, etc.). Three to six capsules of S.O.S. mixed with Complete Kare Spray and SOD Granules to make a paste. Cover the area with a non-stick/non-absorbent pad twice a day (am and overnight). With this in the wound add Immune Plus, 3 tid. Results were 100 percent. Sunburn –- 3 to 4 capsules. Expect reduction of pain within 30 minutes. Blistering will reduce within 6-12 hours. Repeat as needed. Burns or Cuts –– 3 to 4 capsules tid or more. Expect reduction of the severity of pain and significantly less scarring. Repeat daily until the wound is completely healed. Oral Conditions (extractions, abscess. Intra-oral sores).Place 1 capsule directly in the mouth on affected area. Let dissolve and leave the resulting paste in place as long as possible. Repeat using 2 capsules for the second dose.

      "Clinical Conditions: During a 90-day clinical trial by Dino Kotsonis D.C, DACNB, the following conditions/problems were successfully treated with S.O.S. Teething – One or two capsules directly on the gums. Only a small amount is needed for relief. Leaky Gut – Three capsules tid before meals with 2 capsules of GI Complex. Close consideration to the stomach’s ability to provide adequate HCL is paramount in leaky gut Consider HCL complete and the hypochlorhydria protocol. Adrenal Conditions – Use 6-9 capsules per day along with AD Hyper or AD Complex and Sympathetic Balance. The use of S.O.S. with adrenal conditions was effective 100 percent of the time (hyper or hypo). Adrenal conditions: Use for conditions involving “over- worked” the hyperactive adrenal stress system, regardless of the origin. Mental, emotional, chemical, or physical stress test S.O.S against involved origin, such as adrenal, small intestine, immune system, or stomach. Most times there are multiple organ systems involved. Use 2-3 capsules tid. Severe overactive adrenal activity, especially with mental/emotional origins, strongly consider adding the use of Lithium Orotate and Sympathetic Balance, especially with any s/s of cardiac distress and fatigue.” Lithium Orotate -1 capsule tid (or more especially with anxiety or panic s/s). Sympathetic Balance -2 capsules tid. S.O.S. - 2-3 capsules tid. Severe and/or long-term viral problems : (EBV, Covid, etc.) S.O.S. - 3 capsules or more tid. Use with Immune Plus and A.H.F. Severe hyperadrenia conditions: Actual hyper-adrenal - P.O.T.s, where positional changes actually observably increase the heart rate of 30 bpm with an accompanying drop in the systolic blood pressure anywhere from 5 to 80 mm. The following protocol has been extremely useful. (P.O.T.s stands for hyper-adrenal Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome) First morning dose: S.O.S. – 3 capsules, AD Complex - 1 capsule, Power Pill - 1 capsule. If panic is present or heart rate is over 90 at rest, use Sympathetic Balance – 2 capsules at this time. If available add Cataplex E2 - 2 capsules tid, and any form of zucchini(raw, breads, soups etc.) in large amounts daily. Celtic sea salt -1 tsp per qt in pure water, drink before noon. Second dose: S.O.S. - 2-3 capsules, B6/B1- 2 capsules, Sympathetic Balance - 2 capsules Lithium Orotate - 1-2 capsules. Third evening dose: S.O.S. - 2-3 capsules, B6/B1- 2 capsules, Sympathetic balance -2 capsules Lithium Orotate - 1-2 capsules. *Reduce bright lights loud sounds after sunset. The true “hyper-adrenal- P.O.T.s” patients can sometimes only exist with their head below their heart and many wish that they could pass on so the agony will stop. P.O.T.s patients are very fragile, but the response to the above protocol has been quite a gift for many. Any patient that has Ragland dropping bp or increased heart rate related issues, the combination indicated above will go a long way to getting them back on their feet. Caution: Adrenal glandular support, thiamine, may be contraindicated with high blood pressure. (assess their electrolytes). With weakness or under active “exhaustion phase” S.O.S - 3 capsules tid along with the addition adrenal support may be needed. Consider AD Complex -1-2 capsules tid. Support the likely thiamine need with Power Pill – 1 capsules throughout the day. Monitor autonomic changes closely. Adjust dosages accordingly, to balance autonomic changes.

Product contains no milk or milk by-products, egg or egg by-products, corn or corn by-products, fish/shell fish or fish/shell fish by-products, tree nut, wheat or wheat by-products, peanut or peanut by-products, soy or soy by-products. Background Information and Studies Saccharomyces Boulardii exerts a barrier against patho- genic bacteria (Zbinden, et.al. Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease, 1999), enhances immune de- fense mechanisms through its ability to increase production of Secretory IgA (Buts, et.al. Digestive Dis- ease and Sciences, 1990), inhibits the effects of pathogenic bacterial toxins (Castagliuolo, Infection and Immunity, 1999), stimulates enzymatic activity of colonic mucosa and exerts a trophic effect (Buts, et.al. Pediatric Research, 1999), exerts a statistically significant preventive action (p<001) on the occurrence of digestive or genital candidiasis induced by antibiotics (Med. Chir. Dig., 1976) and in several placebo con- trolled double blind studies it had a significant effect on the prevention of diarrhea associated with antibi- otic use (Gastroenterology, 1999, American Journal of Gastroenterology, 1995 and The Journal of The American Medical Association, 1994). Clinical Considerations: Saccharomyces Boulardii should be considered with the following: • Reduced Secretory IgA • Recurring candidiasis • With antibiotics use and antibiotic induced diarrhea • Diarrhea due to food poisoning or gut inflammation (Crohn’s etc.) • While traveling in areas where food and water supply may be contaminated Safety/Precautions: Although very effective with antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs, Saccharomyces Boulardii should be taken away from these drugs (take Saccharomyces Boulardii in the a.m. and even- ing with the drugs taken at different times.

It is incorporated into molecules of glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme helps to protect red blood cells and cell membranes against free radical attack. Selenium is a component of SOD and is also an excellent antioxidant. Clinical Considerations: Selenomethionine has been used for the following: Anti-aging, cer-tain types of Neoplasm's, most viral problems to include HIV, EBV, CMV, etc., cataracts and Coronary Artery Disease. According to Dr. Richard Olree (Minerals for the Genetic Code), only the selenomethionine form of selenium will help to activate SIRT-1 and strengthen the major cancer preventative genes. People at Possible Risk to Selenium Deficiency: Patients on TPN, patients with Crohn’s and other GI inflammatory diseases and patients with cardiomyopathy. Cautions: One citation from the peer reviewed literature indicated that patients with high levels of toenail selenium were at greater risk to Type II Diabetes; however another citation contradicted this information. Also, there is some risk of selenium toxicity when over 1000 micro-grams are ingested for an extended period of time. Common toxicity signs are hair and nail brittleness, garlic breath, fatigue, and skin rashes. Recommendations: One (1) capsule per day or as otherwise directed by your health care professional.

      "Sympathetic Balance Formulated by: Harry O Eidenier, III Description: Two capsules contain 2 mg of thiamine as benfotiamine, 6 mg of rioboflavin-5-phosphate,10 mg niacin as niacinamide, 10 mg of vitamin B6 as P-5-P, 400 mcg of methyl-folate, 400 mcg of vitamin B12 as hydroxocobalamin, 50 mcg of biotin, 2 mg of pantothenic acid, 50 mg of magnesium glycerophosphate, 50 mg of potassium citrate, 6 mg of choline bitartrate, and a 35 mg proprietary blend of L- taurine, porcine brain, porcine liver, porcine stomach tissue (parenchyma/intrinsic factor) and lithium orotate. Clinical Considerations: The nutrients indicated above help to regulate the autonomic nervous system, especially when sympathetic dominance is present (citations from the peer literature listed on the following page). The sympathetic side increases the bodily functions (flight or flight) and the parasympathetic side regulates those areas that require no conscious thought such as rate of breathing, heart rate, HCl production and speed of digestion. Sympathetic Balance was designed to support the autonomic nervous system when the sympathetic side is dominant. Some of the subjective symptoms known to be present with sympathetic dominance include lump in the throat (often secondary to biliary dysfunction – use with GB Complete), unable to relax/startles easily, biliary dysfunction/reduced fat metabolism (use with GB Complete), reduced secretion of hydrochloric acid, high blood pressure (use with Arginine Complex), tachycardia (use with Magnesium Orotate) migraine headaches and Metabolic Syndrome (use with C.G.F.). Sympathetic Balance is also recommended for patients/clients with decreased aldosterone (contains niacin and riboflavin required for aldosterone production). Riboflavin is also essential for MAO-A breakdown of the catecholamines, which decrease androgenic dominance and improves parasympathetic-sympathetic balance. There have been several products produced where B-2 was dominant to B-1 however, none before Sympathetic Balance contained other nutrients to support ANS function such as L-taurine, magnesium, lithium and porcine stomach parenchyma/intrinsic factor required for oral B-12 absorption. This is the most complete product available to support ANS function, especially when sympathetic dominance is present. Recommendations: 1-2 capsules, three times a day.

      "THYROID Description: Each capsule contains 300 milligrams of range grazed/grass fed bovine thyroid. Why such a high dose per capsule? Unlike porcine thyroid, the cross-species specificity of bovine is significantly lower than porcine material. Plus, porcine thyroid material is not available to purchase unless you have a DEA number. Zorex does not have a DEA number (drug license). However, during the clinical trial, THYROID was able to lower thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to a metabolic level in 17 of 19 participants. Clinical Considerations: THYROID should be considered in the following changes in the TSH. If the TSH is > 2.5 but < 7.5, consider one capsule per day. If the TSH is > 7.5 but < 12.5, consider two capsules per day. If the TSH is > 12.5 but < 20, consider three capsules per day. In any case iodine as potassium iodide and selenium (both contained in KI Plus Capsules should be used at one per day or higher if testing justifies more than 12.5 milligrams per day if justified by testing. In any case iodide is needed, and if the T-4 to T-3 ratio is weighted to the T-4 side selenium is needed the agent that removes one molecule of iodine from T-4 and moves it to T-3 is 5’ deiodinase and the heart of 5’ deiodinase (combination of 2 and 3 deiodinase) with heart of all three deiodinases selenium. Selenium insufficiency reduces the ability to transfer one molecule of iodine from T-4 to T-3 with resulting thyroid hypofunction.

      "TomKat In men, testosterone levels decline around the age of 30 and by age 80 may be down to just 20% of the levels found in men in their 20s. Men with low testosterone tend to have less stamina, reduced muscle mass and reduced libido. They can also have cognitive problems as well as depression and anxiety. Low testosterone can lead to more serious health problems. It is linked to obesity and increased abdominal fat, Alzheimer’s disease18, diabetes (33% of type 2 diabetics have low testosterone20), and heart disease16,17. The thing you really notice in men with low testosterone levels is a lack of initiative—they fit the stay‐at‐home, couch‐ potato stereotype. They may say things like, “I used to like to work on the car (go on a hike, go dancing, work around the yard, etc.), but I really don’t feel like doing that anymore.” Women can have low testosterone as well. Levels decline between the ages of 20 and 40. In women low testosterone is linked to a decrease in libido, as well as the other symptoms experienced by men. One of the ingredients in TomKat, Tribulus terrestis, has been shown to increase libido in premenopausal women8. Each serving (four capsules) of TomKat contains a 2580 mg proprietary blend of Indonesian Tongkat Ali E(urycoma longifolia Root Extract), Chinese Red Ginseng, Horny Goat Weed Extract E(pimedium ), Korean Red Ginseng Root P(anax ginseng ), Tribulus terrestis extract, and Maca L(epidium ). Eurycoma longifolia is well studied and has been shown to increase testosterone levels, increase muscle mass, improve sperm counts, improve erectile dysfunction, and treat osteoporosis1,2,3,4,5. Red Ginseng reduces obesity and improves fat metabolism, even in the absence of testosterone. It also improves erectile dysfunction6,7 . Tribulus terrestis has been shown to improve erectile dysfunction, improve sperm quality, and even improve libido in premenopausal women8,9,10 . Epimedium has been shown to improve erectile dysfunction11,13,14. Maca improves sperm count and quality, as well as libido12,14,15. Clinical research as well as citations from the peer reviewed literature (available on request) has shown the botanicals used in TomKat to be safe and effective for the following: Increased immune system function, reduction in allergic responses, increased stamina, increased sex drive, increased athletic performance, and / or Increased growth and repair of muscle tissue. Recommendations: Four capsules in the a.m. or as otherwise directed by a health care professional. Consideration should be given to using TomKat with Liposomal/DIM Chrysin (combines DIM and Chrysin in a liposome for sublingual absorption) to help prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen through the aromatase pathway (a common problem with botanicals/supplements that increase testosterone). Cautions: TomKat should not be used during pregnancy or lactation or by males or females with a history of cancer. Further, it should not be used by males with an increased PSA or by athletes subject to testing for steroids. P.O.

      "Zinc Orotate Zinc deficiency causes slow growth in infants and children, delayed sexual development in adolescents and impotence in men. Zinc deficiency also causes hair loss, diarrhea, eye and skin sores and loss of appetite. Weight loss, problems with wound healing, decreased ability to taste food, and lower alertness levels can also occur. Supplemental zinc has been used to improve the immune system1,2(deficiency is associated with atrophy of the thymus, reduction in white blood cell counts, and increased susceptibility to infection9,10), improve cognition3, wound healing4,5, and improvement in the ability to taste or smell8. Zinc deficiency has been implicated in age-related osteoporosis11, and zinc supplements can speed the healing of fractures in animal models12. Another important role for zinc is in maintaining male reproductive function. Deficiency of zinc is associated with hypogonadism and low levels of serum testosterone (reversible upon supplementation13). It helps with sexual performance6 and sperm quality7. Zinc also appears to be important for the activity of growth hormone (GH) since GH loses effectiveness under conditions of zinc deficiency14 . Why Zinc Orotate? Orotates are the mineral salts of orotic acid, a natural substance found in our bodies and also in various foods including dairy products. Dr. Hans Neiper, a rather controversial figure, postulated that minerals bound to orotates are more easily transported through cell membranes than other forms. Orotate salts are more electrically neutral than other mineral salts and are therefore more lipophilic, making them easier to be transported through the cell membrane (which has two lipid layers). Orotic acid (OA) was once considered to be a vitamin (B13). Although orotic acid isn’t officially considered a vitamin these days, over 40 years ago it was found to have growth-promoting, vitamin-like properties when added to the diets of laboratory animals. Subsequent nutritional studies in humans and animals revealed that OA has a “sparing” effect on vitamin B12, meaning that supplemental OA can partially compensate for B12 deficiency. OA also appears to have a direct effect on folate metabolism. Zinc orotate stabilizes blood glucose and reduces the need for insulin in diabetics, according to Dr. Nieper15. In addition, zinc orotate and other zinc compounds synergize with sulfur-containing antioxidants (sulfhydryls) to protect against free radical-induced tissue injury16,17,a result which may have relevance to the treatment of diabetes as well as other diseases of increased oxidative stress18. Dr. Neiper is a controversial figure, but he is not the only researcher to look into orotates. The value of orotates and orotic acid have, however, been studied by other researchers and found to be of value. Magnesium orotate, for example, has been extensively studied for its cardiac benefits. Orotate and orotic acid have been found to be cardioprotective, even without the magnesium19,20,21,22,23. Carnitine orotate has been found to improve glucose metabolism and fatty liver24,25. In general, orotic acid protects the liver26. Orotates and orotic acid have been studied and found to improve memory and cognition in animal studies27,28.

      "GB Complete (Gall Bladder/Liver Complete) The liver should produce between one and one‐and‐a‐half quarts of bile per day. Small changes in liver and gallbladder function will gradually lower the amount of bile production and lead to biliary stasis. This is especially true of patients who eat a highly refined diet. If biliary stasis is present, the amount of bile produced by the liver decreases. The bile becomes thick and sluggish. If left untreated, bile can back up and cause further damage to the liver. Biliary stasis can also lead to the formation of gallstones. Poor bile production causes poor absorption of essential fatty acids and fat‐soluble nutrients (vitamins A, D, E, and K). The earliest symptom is usually itching. Pain (upper right quadrant, right shoulder or between the shoulder blades), varicosities and spider veins, dry or flaking skin, skin peeling at the heels, deficiencies in oil‐soluble nutri-ents, constipation, and even GERD (gastric reflux) can be the result of biliary stasis. Sometimes the stools will con-tain fat or be clay colored. Other subjective indications include pain over the eyes, pain when pressure is applied to the webbing between the right thumb and forefinger, and pain between the shoulder blades. Biliary stasis is quite common in patients with insulin insensitivity. Approximately 30% of American adults are insulin insensitive and 25% have Syndrome X. The components of GB Complete are designed to thin bile, improve hepatic function, address fatty liver, and even prevent and disrupt gallstone formation. The components of GB Complete include two capsules contain 25mg of vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), 850 mg proprietary blend: of Artichoke extract, Fenugreek seed extract, L‐Taurine, phosphatidylcholine, and Phyllanthus niruri). Science backs the use of GB Complete. the history of artichoke is a perfect example of science finally catching up to the longstanding traditional uses of a medicinal plant. It has traditionally been used for gallstones, to support liver function, and as a liver and gallbladder bile stimulant1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Artichoke extract can increase bile production in patients with biliary stasis 1. The use of artichoke extract avoids the use of beets for patients who have been diag-nosed with oxalate calculi. Other constituents of GB Complete include taurine, which has been shown to inhibit gallstone formation14 and phos- phatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine alleviates fatty liver15. Interference with the production of phosphatidylcholine can lead to cholestasis16. Description: Two capsules contain 25mg of vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), 850 mg proprietary blend: of Artichoke extract, Fenugreek seed extract, L‐Taurine, phosphatidylcholine, Phyllanthus niruri. Recommendations: 2‐4 capsules, 3 times a day with meals or as directed by a health care professional. P.O.

      "IMMUNE PLUS The main ingredient in Immune Plus from Zorex is thymus extract. There is evidence that glandular supplements target the same organ in the consumer as produced by the animal. Dr. A. Kment of Germany demonstrated through radioactive isotope tracing of specific factors from glandular tissues are transported by the bloodstream and absorbed by the corresponding glands of the patient. This has been supported by other research.1 Thymus extracts have been shown to support cellular immunity, and to be beneficial to patients with immnuodeficiency2,3. Thymus extracts have been shown to increase the activity of T cells and B cells4,5,6. Another study found that glandular extracts from liver, lung, and thyroid specifically targeted those organs7. Proprietary base: Plenty of companies make thymus extracts, but Zorex has taken the innovative step of adding synergistic nutrients as well as using a proprietary base of immune modulators. The proprietary base includes Elderberry, Larch Arabinogalactan, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Berberine HCl, N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), Olive Leaf Ext (CLE), Quercetin, Porcine Spleen, Thyme Leaf, Boswellia, Bovine Parotid, Porcine Liver DF, Queens Root, Citrus Bioflavonoids, Porcine Adrenal, Isatis Root, Monolaurin. The glandular support of the liver, spleen, and adrenal further bolsters immunity. Parotid tissue is included to improve absorption (per Dr. George Goodheart). Elderberry can help fight upper respiratory and other viral infections8,9,10. Arabinogalactan is the active ingredient in immune supporting herbs like Echinacea and Astragalus. There are a number of studies that show it to be beneficial to the immune system.11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Infections can trigger a strong, damaging, inflammatory response, as we have seen with COVID. Acetyl-L-Carnitine has been used to offset damage done by virus in HIV patients and those with post COVID18,19. Similarly, NAC can also help prevent the cytokine storm following COVID infection20. Berberine can also help reduce inflammation associated with infection21. Olive leaf will also help reduce oxidative stress associated with infection22. Thyme is antimicrobial and can also reduce inflammation associated with infection23,24. It has also been effective against drug resistant Candida albicans25. Boswellia also offers antioxidant protection26,27. Other herbal constituents include Queen’s Root and Isatis Root. Queen’s root has been used to support the lymphatic system, and it also supports the natural detoxification functions of the mucous membranes, liver and lymphatic tissues. Monolaurin has antimicrobial activity28,29. Itasis root has demonstrated antibacterial and antiviral activity30,31,32,33. Bioflavonoids, like quercetin and citrus bioflavonoids, are anti-inflammatory34,35. Quercetin and other bioflavonoids have antiviral and antibacterial activity as well36,37,38,39,40,41,42. Other constituents: We usually do not think of B vitamins when considering immune support. Studies have, however, shown their value43. They boost the body's defense system and keep energy levels up, which is key to maintaining a healthy immune system. Vitamin B, in particular, has been 6 shown to improve the immune response in critically ill patients44. Vitamin A is important for membrane health45. It has antioxidant and antiviral activity46,47,48. Vitamin A levels drastically decrease when the body is fighting an infection. Vitamin D is also important. Tregs can be increased by vitamin D supplementation.49,50 Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upperrespiratory tract infections50,51,52. Vitamin C is well established as a protective antioxidant, antiviral, and an immune system booster53,54,55. Zinc is vital for the immune system to function properly56,57,58. Seleniumis also important for immune function59. In fact, it has been suggested to be used in conjunction with vitamins D, C, E, and zinc to help COVID patients60. One novel component of Immune Plus is manganese. Manganese can improve immune function and may possibly enhance immune therapy in cancer patients61. Recommendations: Immune Plus was designed and found to be effective for long-term immune support at 2 capsules twice a day. For Acute and chronic bacterial and viral infection at 4 capsules twice a day. This is the most effective combination immune support product available to the healing arts. Availability: Immune Plus is available in 120 capsule bottles. P.O.

      "EMF-DTX Description: EMF -DTX was developed by Jeffrey Sorna, ND, DIHOM. Each spray contains a proprietary blend of distilled water, colloidal silver, boron and electro-magnetic isodes. Clinical Considerations: EMF-DTX is designed to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and especially the radiation from 5G. According to Scientific American, “Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on the general well-being of humans. Damage goes well beyond humans as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life”. The scientists who gathered this information constitute the majority of experts on the effects of EMF/5G radiation. They have published more than 2,000 papers on EMF/5G in professional papers. EMF/5G is not like glyphosate herbicides thatareconsidered safe by the powers that be,they can be avoided by using organically grown produce,thoroughly washing produce etc.But, if you have a cell phone, microwave,Internetrouter, etc., or live neara cell phone toweryou cannot avoid EMF.Although EMF-DTX will not completely block the EMF/5Gdamage,it will significantly limit it ifused on a routine basis. Recommendations: 3 sprays under the tongue twice a day. Percuss on the bottom of the bottle 3 times before use. Availability: EMF-DTX is available in 4 fluid ounce bottles providing 540 sprays per bottle. At 3 sprays twice a day one bottle will provide protection for 90 days. P.O.

      "Estrogen Cream (Bio-Identical/Natural USP Micronized) Description: Each full pump (60 full pumps per container) provides approximately 0.75 mg of natural Estriol USP, formulated to contain 18 mg per ounce. Product also contains a proprietary blend of purified water, Aloe Vera gel, Black Cohosh extract, Burdock Root extract, Shea butter, vegetable glycerin, Milk Thistle extract, Red Clover leaf extract, USP Micronized Estriol extracted from U.S. grown wild Mexican Yam, Siberian Ginseng extract, Chamomile extract, lecithin, Evening Primrose oil, vitamin E, Grape Seed extract and Allantoin. Each full pump contains 750 mcg of natural estriol (E-3) Gluten Free, Paraben Free & Petroleum Free Function and Production: While conventional hormone treatment with estrogen provides certain benefits, it is not without significant risks. USP Estriol will provide most of the benefits without the risks associated with stronger estrogens. The immediate precursors to estriol are androstenedione or testosterone. These precursors are synthesized in the ovaries, adrenal and testes. Estradiol is the major estrogen produced by the ovaries in pre-menopausal females. Literature citations on USP Micronized Estriol can be found on the following page. Clinical Considerations: Estriol is increased during pregnancy but has received little or no attention outside of gestation. It is well known that pregnancy has immunosuppressive effects on many autoimmune problems such as M.S., psoriasis, Hashimoto’s disease, prevention of feminizing cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence exists that USP estriol has potential benefits for many autoimmune problems. It has also been used successfully with Vaginal dryness, pain with sex, PMS, other menopausal symptoms (use with Bio-Identical Natural Micronize Progesterone Cream), osteoporosis, increased blood pressure (use with Arginine Complex), increased blood lipids and vascular disease (use with CircuPlus). While conventional estrogen replacement therapy provides some benefits when a need can be determined through bio-assay, it is not without certain risks that are not present with USP estriol. Availability and Application: Bio-Identical/Natural USP Micronized Estrogen Cream is available in 3 ounce contains (60 full pumps per container). It should be applied directly into the vagina for vaginal dryness or pain with sex and otherwise the application should be rotated (chest, throat, abdomen, inner arms or thighs). 1/2 to 1 full pump once or twice a day.

      "QUERCETIN Description: Each capsule contains 500 mg of Quercetin, 100 mg of Bromelain and 100 mg of Rutin. Quercetin is a flavonoid belonging to a group of polyphenolic compounds that are produced exclusively in plants (citrus fruit and onions primarily). Rutin is sourced from buckwheat, and several fruits. Zorex International uses onions for quercetin and buckwheat for rutin. Clinical Considerations: Quercetin helps to block the sorbitol pathway (entry into the nerve cells, kidneys, and eyes), tissues where excess glucose causes damage, and failure with uncontrolled diabetes (In vitro and in vivo evidence that quercetin protects against diabetes and its complications: A systemic review of the literature, Jang-Shi and Associates, China Pharmaceutical University). Quercetin can reduce inflammation by scavenging free radicals. Inflammation is always increased in patients with acute and chronic disease, most especially viral, and bacterial infection (A Review of Flavonoid Quercetin: Metabolism, Bioactivity and Antioxidant Properties, Alrawaiq and Abdullah, Department of Pharmacology, Kebangsaan University, Malaysia). It has been demonstrated that quercetin has ability to help transport zinc into the cell with viral infection, (Eidenier, Jamieson, Furda and Associates, Biochemical Blood Biopsy). Quercetin will help to inhibit testosterone to estrogen conversion through the aromatase pathway, Inhibition of estrogen in human liver microsomes by quercetin and other flavonoids, (Huang and Associates, Department of Environmental Health, University of New York at Albany, New York, USA). Quercetin is a well-known and clinically established antihistamine, (Quercetin and its Anti-Allergic Immune Response, Micek and Associates, Molecules). Like zinc, rutin is a natural cofactor to quercetin. It is effective as a cancer protective agent, antioxidant, anti- inflammatory, has been found to be effective with autism, viral and bacterial infections, hemorrhoids, most skin conditions, and spider veins, (The Beneficial Role of Rutin, A Natural Occurring Flavonoid in Health and Disease Prevention, Patel and Associates, Science Direct). Conclusion: Quercetin and Rutin have been shown to be effective adjunctive treatment for systemic inflammation, as an aromatase inhibitor, as a natural means of limiting glucose into the eyes, nerves, and kidneys for patients with diabetes, as adjunctive support with viral and other infections, as a natural antihistamine and a known transport agent for zinc.

      "KI Caps (Potassium Iodide) Description: Each capsule of KI Caps contains 5 mg of vitamin B2 (as riboflavin 5’ Phosphate), 12.5 mg of iodine (as potassium iodide), 200 mcg of Selenomethionine and 100 mg of L-Tyrosine. Special Note: Selenomethionine was included in the KI Caps because more than 80% of T-3 is produced peripherally by the removal of iodine from the 5’ position of T-4 (deiodination). This process occurs via a selenoprotein called 5’de-iodinase which has selenomethionine in its active site. Selenomethionine should always be used with iodine, hence its inclusion in KI Caps. A summary paper on iodine for breast and whole health is available upon request. Clinical Considerations: According to the peer reviewed literature, iodine is antibacterial, anti-neoplastic, anti-parasitic, antiviral, increases pH and serves as a mucolytic agent. KI-Caps should be considered for fibrocystic breast disease, acne, parotid stones, prostate problems, ovarian and uterine problems, intercostal neuralgia, atherosclerosis, headaches (use with Celtic Sea salt), depression, cracks in the skin on the hands or feet, thyroid hypo and hyperfunction and Hashimoto’s. Also, with Hashimoto’s, the patient should be checked via a secretory IgA to ascertain gut immunity. Decreased gut immunity is common with Hashimoto’s as is sensitivity to gluten. KI Caps should only be used while under the direct supervision of a health care professional. Urinary iodine excretion testing should always be employed to determine short and long-term iodine needs. High dose iodine (more than 12.5 mg a day) is usually well tolerated by most people, however some people with iodine sensitivity, Hashimoto’s, goiter (Riboflavin 5’- Phosphate is added to KI-Caps to help prevent goiter) do not tolerate iodine well. KI-Caps are contraindicated with iodine induced thyroid hypofunction, thyroid cancer and iodism (metallic taste in the mouth). KI-Caps should be considered at 1 capsule daily and increased/decreased as determined by urinary iodine excretion testing. In some cases, niacin is needed as a co-factor to iodine and with these cases Niacin 250 should also be considered at one per day. Recommendations: 2 capsules per day or as otherwise directed by a health care professional. Availability: KI Caps are available in 90 capsule bottles.

      "Phosphatidylcholine Description: Each capsule of Phosphatidylcholine from Zorex International contains 1200 mg of phosphatidylcholine complex, which provides 420 mg of phosphatidylcholine. It also contains other phospholipids, including phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Consider it for conditions where the health of the cell membrane matter. Some practitioners consider it vital to any detoxification regimen. It keeps toxins from clinging to cell membranes (especially in the nervous system). The choline combination indicated is useful for the health of brain tissue, nerve tissue, the microbiome, lung tissue, hepatic tissue, and other mammalian cells in the body. Further, patients with decreased levels of choline are at great risk to liver cirrhosis and fatty liver cirrhosis. Clinical Conditions: Think of the structure of phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a choline head, a glycerol body and two fatty acid legs. The architecture of phosphatidylcholine parallels that of the cell membrane. It is accepted by the membrane as a building block, incorporating itself into the cell’s structure. It is taken to enhance the health of cell membranes. Since the structure of PC contains fatty acids, the quality of the fatty acids consumed matters1,2. When supplementing with PC, make sure that the patient is consuming good fats in the diet; you may also consider giving a good fatty acid supplement, like SunFlax Complex. One of the best researched use of phosphatidylcholine is in ameliorating liver damage. There are many studies that show its benefit for patients with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver3,4,5,6,7. PC use in both hepatitis B and hepatitis C has been studied and found to have a positive effect8,9,10,11. When you think of phosphatidylcholine, think of cellular repair. Inflammatory bowel disease is all about damage to the cells lining the intestine, and patients can benefit from PC supplementation. Studies have shown that PC supplementation is extremely helpful to patients with ulcerative colitis12,13,14,15. You may consider it for your patients with leaky gut. PC is good to give to patients taking NSAIDs. Studies show that PC can reduce the damage done to the GI tract by these drugs16,17. The brain and nervous system have a high content of lipids and phospholipids. PC may be valuable for long-term health of the brain and nervous system. It may be possible to slow the progression of dementia by replenishing the phospholipids in the brain. There are studies that show the benefits of phosphatidylcholine supplementation to the nervous system. PC is useful for the health of the brain tissue itself. Higher phosphatidylcholine levels were associated with thicker grey matter in the prefrontal cortex and with cognitive flexibility18. Animal studies have shown that PC supplementation protects the brain from dementia and even improves memory.19,20 PC may also be beneficial to patients with asthma. Inhalation of nanoparticles of PC improved lung function tests in asthmatics, according to one study21. Another study found that a combination of PC and iodine was also found to be effective in relieving the symptoms of patients with childhood asthma22. In general, this combination seems to benefit patients with allergies23,24. Recommendations: With Liver cirrhosis or fatty liver product should be dosed at 6-7 tid, with other conditions 1-2 tid and in either case it should be used with GB Complete and E.N.V./GBLV Homeopathic.
