    "text": "Menopause and Perimenopause Management  Progesterone functions as a \nneurosteroid with important GABA receptor modulation and estrogen -balancing effects. \nResearch demonstrates 83% reduction in hot flash frequency and severity after 12 \nweeks of treatment, with significant improvements in sleep architecture through \nincreased slow -wave sleep and reduced nighttime awakenings.  \nPremenstrual Syndrom e and Menstrual Support  Bio-identical progesterone \naddresses luteal phase deficiency and estrogen dominance symptoms. Clinical studies \nshow significant reductions in irritability, mood swings, water retention, and breast \ntenderness, with effective regulati on of menstrual cycles and reduction in anovulatory \npatterns.  \nEstrogen Balance and Protective Effects  Progesterone counteracts estrogen's \nproliferative effects, reducing endometrial proliferation by approximately 40% and \nmodulating breast tissue activity. Research demonstrates downregulation of estrogen \nreceptors and induction of enzymes that metabolize estrogens to less stimulatory forms.  \nBone Health and Metabolic Support  Direct osteoblast stimulation promotes new bone \nformation while having minimal effect s on bone resorption. Combined with estrogen \ntherapy, provides 1.5% higher spinal bone density compared to estrogen alone, with \nindependent bone -preserving effects even without concurrent estrogen.  \nDosing Protocols  \nPremenopausal Cyclical Use : \u00bd to 1 pump d aily during luteal phase (days 14 -28 of \ncycle) Postmenopausal Continuous : \u00bd pump daily for ongoing hormonal support \nMenopausal Symptoms : \u00bd to 1 pump once or twice daily for vasomotor symptom \ncontrol Estrogen Dominance : \u00bd pump daily with monitoring for symp tom improvement \nMale Andropause : \u00bc to \u00bd pump daily for hormonal balance support  \nTiming Considerations:  \n\u2022 Apply to thin -skinned areas (inner arms, thighs, chest, abdomen) for optimal \nabsorption  \n\u2022 Rotate application sites to prevent skin saturation and maintain absorption  \n\u2022 Evening application enhances sleep benefits through GABA receptor modulation  \n\u2022 Cyclical use in premenopausal women aligns with physiological patterns  \n\u2022 Upper body application sites provide more consistent absorption than lower body  \nCombination Strat egies  \nWith Estrogen Cream : Comprehensive menopausal support and endometrial \nprotection With Sympathetic Balance : Enhanced stress response and autonomic ",

Hence the dietary suggestions below.\na.Pitocin (a drug used to induce birth).\nb.Anesthesia and pain control drugs used during the birth process.\nc.Mercury-based preservatives in vaccines or the vaccines themselves.\nd.Reduced fecal chymotrypsin indicating abnormal pancreatic function.\ne.Psychological or physical stress.\nf.Vitamin B-12/folate deficiency.\ng.Food aller gy/sensitivity.\nh.Use of narcotics, tobacco, excess alcohol and/or poor diet by the mother during\npregnancy ( excess refined foods, excess use of foods high in mercury, etc.).\n1.Intestinal parasites (amoebic).\nJ.Sub-acute viral or bacterial infection.\n2.Dietary Suggestions: Although diet alone will probably not completely resolve autism,\nbecause pancreatic dysfunction is involved in many cases, dietary changes to ensure the\nfollowing may result in patient improvement:\na.Drink plenty of pure water each day (no well or city water).\nb.Eliminate gluten, dairy, refined foods, hydrogenated fats and oils, alcohol,\ncaffeine, fruit juice and packaged foods containing dyes, additives and/or\npreservatives.\nc.Increase raw and fresh food and quality proteins.\nd.Increase raw oils, especially those containing DHA.\ne.Rule out food allergy/sensitivity.\n3.Primary Supplemental Support: Although there is no evidence that supplemental\nsupp01t alone will completely resolve autism. However, supplemental support coupled with\ndietary changes has caused improvement. Autism is a problem requiring a\nmultidisciplinary approach by professionals trained in the treatment of this problem. The\nsupplement levels indicated below are for children, levels should be increased for adults.\nContinued On The Following Page: \n41 ",

Most experts agree that\nLyme disease is under-reported. Patients who present with Lyme disease type symptoms\n(rash, fever, etc.), should also be checked for Babesia rnicroti. Serum changes include\nincreased ALT/SGPT, increased sedimentation rate, increased interleukin-6, increased CRP,\nand increased immunoglobulin M.\n2.Dietary Suggestions:\na.Drink at least 8 full glasses of pure water daily (no well water or city water).\nb.Eliminate refined foods, alcohol, gluten, dairy (excep t butter) and\nhydrogenated fats and oils. Increase raw and fresh foods.\n3.Primary Supplemental Support:\na.During the early part of the infection a skin rash develops in majority of\npatients and if the disease is localized, other significant manifestations\n(arthritis, cardiac and/or nerve disease primarily) will be lacking. During\nthis phase, treatment with high dose antibiotics is sometimes successful.\nb.If the problem is not caught or addressed properly in the early stage, late\u00ad\nstage Lyme disease will usually develop. During this phase, arthritis,\ncardiac disease and/or nerve disease often devel ops, and the high dose antibiotic\ntreatment is frequently less successful.

The heart  of the product is  the alcohol soluble \nextract of porcine liver originally called Anabolin and produced by Harrower Laboratory (Henry \nHarrower, M.D.).  Soon after D r.

Zorex  International was able to obtain the original formula, produce the \nextract and include it in the A.H.F.  produc t. In Dr. Harrower\u2019s original notes ( An Endocrine \nHandbook),  Dr. Harrower  indicted that Anabolin was available several years before Japanese \nscientists were able to isolate Yakriton, still sold as Antronex. D r.

The \nwater-soluble forms (thiamine HCL, thiamine mono-nitrate, etc.), have their place in the use of \nsupplemental thiamine therapy, however the water-soluble forms have slower absorption, and \nreduced ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, an important factor with serum glucose problems \n(increased or decreased). For this reason(s) many products produced by Zorex International \nwhere increased or reduced serum glucose, inability to get sufficient glucose across the blood-\nbrain barrier, decreased Co2, and increased anion gap, benfotiamine was chosen as the thiamine \ncomponent of several products. With significant thiamine deficiency as seen with acidosis, \ndiabetes, low blood pressure, need for supplemental HCl, reactive hypoglycemia, Benfotiamine is \nalways the best choice. Suggested dose is 1-2 capsules per day.\nBerberine HCL \u2013 Each capsule  contains 500 mg of Berberine HCl (99% plus pure berberine \nextracted). Peer reviewed literature and clinical results support Berberine HCl as a natural \nantibiotic, for cardiac support, for its ability to relieve fever and most importantly for its ability \nto reduce A1c. In fact, in  two peer reviewed studies it was as effective in reducing A1c as \nMetformin, without the known side effects associated with Metformin.

Conventional \nestrogen replacement therapy provides some benefits when a need can be determined through \nbioassay, it\n is not without certain risks.

Natural progesterone should \nalways be considered when bioassay indicates that total estrogen is increased. With serum te sting for \ntotal estrogen always consider values greater than the mid- line of  the lab range to be elevated. The \nnormal premenopausal pattern for progester one secretion during a given month is for the ovaries to \nproduce progesterone in the second two weeks of the menses cycles (day 14 thr ough 28, beginning \nat ovulation and ending at the start of menses). Little progesterone is produced in the following two \nweeks, and this is when it should be used for pre- menstrual females. With post-m enopausal  females \nand males (especially those undergoing testoster one therapy), natural progesterone should be \nconsidered for the problems previously noted as well as to help regulate the product ion of cortisol, \nprolactin, androgens, and especially to help normalize pituitary and hypothalamus function.

    "text": "Bioti n \u2013 Each capsule contains 50 mg of Biotin -D considered by most experts to be the most \nactive form of supplemental biotin. Biotin-D has been found to be helpful adjunctive treatment \nfor supporting neurological functions, helping to steady blood sugar and DNA levels,  and as \nexcellent support for hair, skin, and nail health problems . Since biotin is produced by healthy \nbacteria in the microbiome, patients with small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) , leaky gut \nsyndrome, candida, IBS, et c., should consider boron as adjunctive therapy . Biotin-D should \nalso be considered any time a patient/client is suffering with a bacterial issue in the microbiom e \nor diarrhea secondary to the bacterial infection. Accord ing to the peer li terature, biotin \ndeficiency is a factor in more than 40 percent of females with hair  loss. Biotin is also being used \nby several health care professionals in the adju nctive treat ment of M .S. at 200 mg per day (4 \ncapsules ). High dose Biotin-D will change serum thyroid values but, wil l not change or harm \nthyroid function. Therefore, high dose biotin therapy should be discontinued for 10-14 days \nbefore initiating thyroid testing. With antibiotics  biotin as well as Saccharomycesb Boulardii \nshould be used. The Saccharomyces Boulardii to help replace essential bacteria in the \nmicrobiome and biotin because antibiotics will destroy the bacteria t hat produce biotin. With \nexception of M.

Food grade boron has bee n used successfully in the regulation of estradiol (E -2), \ntestosterone,  free test osterone and has been helpful in decreasing sex hormone binding \nglobulin (SHBG).  Although many professional formulas for osteoporosis  contain boron, the \namount is usually too low. With this  mind, when using a formula for o steoporosis if the total \nboron content is less t han 6 mg, one capsule of Boron should be added to the patient\u2019s \nsupplemental support (there is no known toxic level for boron at supplemental levels up to 20 \nmg per day ). Boron will increase the absorption of calcium, magnesium and vitamin D that are \nnutrients common in the support of os teoporosis . An excellent summary article on the \ntherapeutic uses of boron Nothing Boring About Boron, written by Pizzorno in Integrative \nMedicine, provides over 135 citations from the peer reviewed literatur e on the clinical use of \nboron as boron calcium fructoborinate.

The others average between 30 and 70 perc ent but, the average \nabsorption rate for calcium orotate is 90 percent ( Global Healing) .

Like magnesium,  calcium  should be dosed on an empty \nstomach (a.m. and at be dtime) as it will combine with fat in the G. I. and form an insoluble soap \ncausing a reduction in calcium.  The exception to this is with  fever when it should be dosed \nhourly until the fever begins to abat e. For other conditions  consider 3 capsules in the a.m . and \n3-4 at bedtime.",

It was also fou nd that C.G.F.\u00ae had all\nthe required nutrients (riboflavin, B6, B1, molybdenum, methyl-fol ate, and methyl-cob alamin) to\nhelp with the conversion of serum iron to heme (co-fa ctor anemia). When used with the\nmodified Simeon diet for weight loss C.G.F.\u00ae should be used at 4 qid . With hypo and hyper-\nglycemia it should be considered at 2-3 tid. Product has also been used with great success for\npatient/clien ts with Metabolic Syndr ome (increased LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL\ncholesterol and triglycerides increased in relation to the total cholesterol). This is one of  the\nfinest glycemic formula s available to the professional healing arts. Consider 2-3 tid and 3  at\nbedtime for patients who can get to sleep but not remain asleep more than a couple of hours. If\nunable to get to sleep use with Sympathetic Balance - 2 at bedtime.\nChrysin \u2013 Each capsule contains 300 mg of chrysin extracted from passionflower grown in the \nU.S. Because chrysin is difficult for some patients/clients to absorb, 2 mg of BioPerine was \nadded to the capsule to facilitate absorption across the gut barrier. Chrysin should be \nconsidered for increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen through the aromatase \npathway, and for patients with increased total serum estrogen levels. It has also been found to \nbe effective adjunctive therapy with Parkinson\u2019s disease, HIV-1 infection, antioxidant, anti-\ntumor support, hepatic support, increased platelet aggregation, unresponsive prostate \nhypertrophy and as an anti- inflammatory. Consider  at 1-2 tid, do not exceed 6 per day. ",

The product was designed to treat iron \noverload/  hemochromatosis. The  gold standard indicator for iron overload/hemochromatosis \nis a percent of iron s aturation greater than 50.  Although ferritin may also be high, it is  not \ngenerally the best indication (unless over 500) of iron overload or hemochromatosis . Ferritin \nwill also increase above the metabolic level with inflammation, neoplasm, H IV, pr otein \ndeficiency , and myriad of other problem s. Again,  the gold standard diagnosis is a percent of \niron saturation greater than 50. When FE -X is used it should be used with an iron and copper \nfree multiple mineral formula at 2 bid. Fe -X sh ould be considered at 3 bid. If after  45 day s of \nthis therapy if the percent of iron saturation remains greater than 50, gene tes ting should be \ninitiated to determine if the problem is iron overload or hemochromatosis (generally an \ninherited problem). If t he patient is only one gene positive the problem is probably iron \noverload,  however  if the patient is  2 or 3 gene positive the problem is pr obably \nhemochromatosi s. With hemochromatosis all 1st degree relatives of the patient/ client should \nbe contacted because, as pr evious indicated, hemochromatosis is generall y an inherited \nproblem . In any case ph lebotomy  is required and some cases, pharmaceutical support \n(phlebotomy is  always the best choice). In  cases where the serum  ferritin is normal or \ndecreased with and the serum iron is increased this pattern is often associated with zinc \ninsufficiency or copper exc ess. Again, consider Fe-X at 3 bid along with an iron and copper \nfree multiple minerals at 2 bid. Iron overload and hemochromatosis are both silent killers and \nshould never be untreated when discovered via laboratory t esting.  Always rule out zinc \ninsufficiency  (Zinc Orotate) with iron overload.  If the percent of saturation is normal after 45 \ndays on Fe-X, wait 45 days and complete a serial check of the iron percent of saturation. If the percent is again  increased then phlebotomy is needed along with gene testing to rule out hemochromatosis.

The acid in the capsule is Betaine HCL and the acid \nextracted from Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, no t the Apple Cider Vinegar as this would be \ndestroyed by the Betain e HCl .

The explanation for secondary  biliary \n(gall bladder) or pancreatic dysfunction is com plex. However, in simple terms , recall that \nwhen the chyme passes through the pyloric cap it must be sufficiently acid (< 2.5) to correc tly \ninitiate cholecystokinin (instructs the gall bladder to release bile) and secretin (instruc ts the \npancreas to release pancreatic bicarbonate) and without sufficient ac idity that chyme is not \nsufficiently alkaline and thus passes through the gut barrier causing systemic acidity which is \nnot correct, and results in the syste m attem pting to alkalinize the chyme with Co2 and alkaline \nmineral s. So, with all this in mind always remember that hypochlorhydria can be nexus to \nbiliary and pancreatic dysfunction.  Without access to Heidelberg Gastro-Telemetry t o \ndetermine hypochlorhydria, blood chemistry can be very useful.

However, the literature fails to \nconsider that in the absence of microscopic bleeding, excessive menses bleeding, or diets that \nare very low in iron containing foods, the nexu\ns for iron anemia is often due to hypochlorhydria \n(inability to breakdown and absorb iron). Hence the choice to use iron citrate (citrate being acid) \nas the carrier for the iron component. Many will also ask why the product does not contain \nfolate. Although many iron supplements in a tablet or capsule form do contain folate, in a \nproduct that is aqueous (Iron-Plus), folate is not stable, and although the label may list folate as \na component, it was probably there when the product was produced, bu\nt bioassay will reveal \nthat it is no longer there 2-4 weeks after the product was produced. Hence, the lack o\nf folate in \nIron-Plus. Iron-Plus should be considered with iron anemia as seen with a decreased present of \niron saturation, decreased ferritin, and increased total iron binding (TIBC). Subjectively iron \nneed as seen with cold hands and feet, cracks in the fingernails, excess blood loss during \nmenses and iron replacement with hypochlorhydria.

Lithium carbonate, a drug requiring a script, is used at u p to 300 mg tid or qid \nand provides from 170 to 222 mg of elemental lithium per day. Lithium  carbonate requires \nclose monitoring via serum to ensure the drug has not reached a toxic level that can cause \nsevere problems . Lithium  orotate does not, req uire serum monitoring and according to the \nliterature has been proven safe and effective at up to 50 mg per day.  U.S. manufactured \nlithium orotate has been shown to be effective a t returning urates back to solution for removal \nby the system  (gout, calcium uraye calculi), with manic, bi-polar, and general depression, \nhelps to reduce violent behavior, helpful with enuresis and M.S., shown to improve i mmune, \nhepatic, cardiovascul ar and thyroid function. Clinical studies  have also shown low dose lithium \nto be excellent adjunctive treatment for alcohol and drug addiction, effective with many cases of migraine and cluster headaches, seizure disorders, it s ability to increase total white blood \ncounts when other more commonly used supplemental support has failed, and its \neffectiveness in helping with Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Amyotrophic  Lateral Sclerosis . \nDr. \nNieper was a genius and the uses he proposed for lithium orotate have stood the test of tim e. \nLithium Orotate has a myriad of uses and should be part of all health c are provider\u2019s \npharmacie s. It should be considered at 1-2 tid,  providing a total of 12 t o 24 mg of elemental \nlithium . For better respo nse with lithium therapy consider using with Sympathetic Balance.  \n.For those of you that are not familiar with orotates (orotic acid), it is also know as vitamin B -\n13 Mkling it a wonderful, natural carrier for lithium and other minerals.  \nL.P.A. Plus (Alpha Lipoic Acid) \u2013 Each c apsule c ontains 100 mg of A lpha Lipoic Ac id, 50\nmg of mixed ascorbates and 30 mg of natural mixed tocopherols, The lipoic acid content as\nwell as the mixed ascorbates are sourced from U.S. AAA manufacturers. L. P.A. Plus should\nbe considered with alcoholism, toxic element exposure (use with H .M.D. Heavy  Metal D etox\nHomeopathic, KI Caps,  and Oregano Oil Caps Emulsified). When used with mer cury L.P.A,\nPlus should be used at one capsule every three hours dur ing waking hours and 1 capsule\nevery 4 hours at night for five day with two day off, for 5-6 weeks.  A ser ial examination for\nmercury should be com pleted after 5-6 weeks (generally the patient and health care provider\nwill find the mercury level below the t oxic level). L.P. A. Plus should also be considered f or\npatients  with high blood sugar and/or diabetes (use with C.G.F.\u00ae) and with atherosclerosis  use\nwith CircuPlus, 8X Panc reatin and Arginine Complex).",

    "text": "Lymphatic Drainag e \u2013 Product was developed by Jeffrey Sorna, DiHOM & Harry O Eidenier, III. \nEach four- ounce bottle contains a proprietary blend of distilled water, colloidal silver, zinc, boron \nand electromagnetic isodes. The lymphatic system is part of our immune system that assists our \nvarious systems to protect against disease, inflammation, autoimmune problems, and infections. \nSegments of the lymphatic system  include lymph nodes, plasma cells, the spleen and appendix. \nThe supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is performe d by the blo od and involves a net \nleakage of fluid outward at the capillary level. The principal function of the lymphatic system is to \ngather this fluid and return it to the blood. Congestion interrupts this function and results in \nswelling in the tissues and in most cases lymph edema with resulting inflammation and \ndiminished system function. Ac cording to the literature , lymph edema or congestion (failure to \ndrain) can result in free rad ical problems, cardiac disease, inflammation, and infection. Lymphatic \ndrainage is the forst step in detoxification.Suggested dose is one teaspoon full twice a day. Bottle \nshould be percussed three times before each d ose. \nMagne sium Glycerophosphate Complex \u2013 Each tablet contains 100 mg of elemental \nmagnesium as magnesium glycerophosphate and 10 mg of taurine. M any of you may ask \u2013 why \ndoes Zorex Int ernational have so many different types of magnesium? My answer is, elemental \nmagnesium is elemental magnesium, the different types exce pt for magnesium oxide, which is \nhard to break down, will generally provide results when magnesium deficiency is present. \nHowever, glycerophosphate has the highest bowel tolerance of all the carriers (7 percent, the \nsame as placebo in studies), so it would be the correct choice for a pati ent who needs \nmagnesium, but even small doses (less than the RDA), cause loo se stools or diarrhea. \nMagnesium Glycerophosphate Complex, in addition to being the best choice for patients who get \nloose stools from low  doses, should also be the first choice with muscle contraction and \nrelaxation, for general relaxation, sympathetic dominance (use with Sympathetic Balance with \nsympathetic dominance and I.R.F. with insomnia) glycemic issues (most patients with high blood \nsugar (use with C.G.F.\u00ae ) are magnesium deficient), as well as for patients with epilepsy, \nabnormal hea\nrt rhythm, virus and asthma (magnesium deficiency common with upper respiratory \nproblems) hypochlorhydria (us e with HCL Complete) and adrenal hypofunction (use with AD \nComplex). Dose magnesium to b owel tolerance at bedtime when there is little or no fat present \nin the G.I. (magne sium will bind with fat and form an insoluble soap that significantly reduces \nboth the absorption of fat as well as the magnesium). Oral magnesium, without regard to the \ncarrier, should not be used with renal disease. Consider 4 tablets at bedtime, increasing nightly to \nbowel tolerance. ",

Only U.S. manufactured orotates  (Nieper \norotates) are used in thi s product.  It is important to ensure the product  you may be using is \nmade with U .S. sourced orotate as  they have never been cited for caus ing hepatic \ninflammation as some p roduced in As ia. have. According to Dr.  Nieper,  who in our opinion, \nwas a genius, indicated that magnesium orotate is useful for patients/clients with M .S., \nrecovery from cardiac disease/attack, heart surgery, to improve athletic performance, and to \nhelp lower elevated ser um lipid levels (use with CircuPlus, L.P.A.  Plus,  Arginine Complex  and \n8X Pancreatin).  There are myriad of clinical uses for magnesium, but  these are the problems \nwhere Magnesium Orotate has out -performed other forms of magnesium.  Many o f you \nbelieve that the serum levels for magnesium are accurate, we do not. W e have  found that \nany value below 2.2 is too low and even those above 2.2 will be found below 6.0, which is the \nlow metabolic level for RBC magnesium.  Altho ugh RBC magnesium is more costl y than \nserum to run, it is much more accurate. Consider six capsules at bedtim e, increasing every \nother  evening until bowel tolerance is reached. If the bowel tolerance is reached at a low level \n(6 capsules or less) then a need for taurine (major carrier of magnesium to the RBC) is \nprobably present and that brings us to the next  magnesium supplement that contains  taurine. \nAlso see Magnesium G lycerophos phate Complex information for patie nts who have a low  \ntolerance to oral magnesium . Magnesium  orotate should not  be used with ren al disease. \nConsider  four capsules at bedtime increasing nightly to bowel tolerance.  \nMagnesium Taurinate \u2013 Each caps ule contains 1000 mg of magnesium taurinate yielding 80 \nmg of elemental magnesium, 720 mg of taurine and 14.4 mg of potassium citrate (5 capsules \nprovide the RDA for m agnesium).  Magnesium  has been found to be a useful adjunctive \ntreatment as a calcium  antagonist (recall that calcium is ubiquitous in nature and \nmanufactured foods, magnesium is not). It should be considered with some cases of  tinnitus, \nas a cofactor to potass ium, fo r vegetarians due to the taurine component, in the treatment \nand prevention of seizures, cataracts (use with (Eye Defense), and as a cof actor to myriad of \nenzymes required for human health.  If your patient/client  continues  to have a low RBC \nmagnesium (below 6.0) taking other forms of magnesium, the problem, can be a taurine \ndeficienc y. Taurine is one of the major carriers in the trans fer of magnesium int o the RBC. \nThis is the patient that will benefit the most from Magnesium Taurinate rat her than \nmagnesium with other carriers. Magnesium Taurinate should also be your \u201cgo to\u201d form or \nmagnesium if the patient has hypertension. Both magnesium  and taurine are considered \nprimary  intervention with hypertension.  Magnesium  taurinate should not be used with renal \ndisease or during pregnancy.  Consider  five capsules at bedtime, increasing by one capsule \nevery  other  evening to bowel tolerance.",

It is support for the synergistic organs involved with stress upon the body, as stress is\nhandled not only by the adrenal, but affects many organs of the body, the system. This product is\ndeveloped with the \u201cSupport of the System\u201d in mind. It has been shown to be the missing piece in\nthe puzzle in many situations. The original concept was from Dr George Goodheart\u2019s observations,\nthat \u201cStress doesn\u2019t cause anything, but it makes whatever you have worse.\u201d\nTopically on wounds: (diabetic ulcers, insect bites, etc.) \nRemove any debris (stingers splinters, thorns, etc.), then use Complete Kare Spray to sterilize the \nwound. S.O.S. - open 3-6 capsules, depending on wound size and mix with Complete Kare Spray to \nmake a paste and apply directly to the wound. If the wound is severe, add SOD granules to the mix. \nCover with a non-stick, non-absorbent bandage and tape to the skin and leave on overnight. \nRemove the bandage the following morning. \nFollow this procedure until the wound is healed. *Photograph area prior to the first application, as \nwell as each time it is repeated to record progress.\nS.O.S. - 3 capsules daily until the wound is completely healed. \nWith redness in the wound area : Immune Plus - 3 capsules tid. A.H.F. - 3 capsules tid.\nUntil the wound is completely healed. \nSunburn use: S.O.S. - 3 to 4 capsules. Expect reduction of pain within 30 minutes.\nBlistering will reduce within 6-12 hours. Repeat as needed.\nBurns or cuts: S.O.S. \u2013 3 to 4 capsules tid or more. Expect reduction of the severity of pain and \nsignificantly less scarring. Repeat daily until the wound is completely healed. \nSurgical procedures:  S.O.S \u2013 3 to 4 capsules tid for 3-5 days prior to procedure. \nAfter the procedure, use 3 to 4 capsules tid, until the wound is completely healed. \nOral conditions: (extractions, abscess, and intra-oral sores)\nS.O.S. \u2013 Place 1 capsule directly in the mouth on affected area. Let dissolve and leave the resulting \npaste in place as long as possible. Repeat using 2 capsules for the second dose.\n*Note:  Dental surgical procedures where stitches are placed to close wounds, pay close attention\nas the reduction of healing time can be reduced by as much as 50%. If close attention is not paid,\nthere may have to be another surgical procedure to remove them as the wound may heal over the\nstiches\u2019 entirely. Give healing time 50% less than expected, to inspect stiches  for removal. Use as\nsuggested in \u2018oral conditions\u2019 above as well as take 3-4 capsules orally tid.",

Again, this is \nan excellent long term EFA that is therapeutic and avoids the contaminants known to be \npresent in our oceans, the source of fish oil Consider 1-2 soft gels tid. \nSympathetic Balance \u2013  Product designed by Harry O Eidenier, III.  Two capsules contain 2 \nmg of thiamine as benfotiamine, 6 mg of riboflavin as riboflavin-5-ph osphate, 10 mg of \nniacinamide, 10 mg of vitamin B6 as P-5-P,  400 mcg of folate as methyl-fo late, 400 mcg of \nvitamin B- 12 as hydroxocobalamin, 50 mcg of biotin, 2 mg of pantotheni c acid, 50 mg of \nmagnesium as magnesium glycerophosphate, 50 mg of potassium citrate, 6 mg of choline as \ncholine bitartrate and a proprietary blend of DMG, L-ta urine, porcine brain, porcine liver, \nporcine stomach tissue (parenchyma/intrinsic factor), and lithium orotate. These  nutrients help \nto regul ate the autonomic nervous system (ANS), especially when sympathetic dominance is \npresent. The sympathetic side increases bodily functions (fight or flight), and the \nparasympathetic side regulates those areas that require no conscious thought such as rate of \nbreathing, heart rate, HCl production and speed of digestion. Sympathetic Balance was \ndes\nigned to support autonomic function when the sympathetic side is domin ant. Some of the \nsubjective indicators known to be present with sympathetic dominance are lump in the throat, \nunable to relax/startles easily, biliary dysfunction/reduced fat m etabolism (use with GB \nComplete), reduced appetite, reduced secretion of hydrochloric acid, high blood pressure  (use \nwith Arginine Complex), gag easily (use with GB Complete), tachycardia (use with \nMagnesium Orota te), migraine headaches, heart rate variability, and Metabolic Syndrome (use \nwith C.G.F.\u00ae ). Sympathetic Balance is also recommended for patients, with re duced \naldosterone (contains niacin and riboflavin required for aldosterone production) and is \nessential for MAO-A breakdown of the catecholamines which decrease androgenic dominance \nand improves, as previously stated, the parasympathetic /symp athetic balance. There have \nbeen several products produ ced where B-2 was dominant to B-1 however, none before this \nproduct conta ined other synergists such as L-taurine, magnesium, lithium, and porcine \nstomach parenchyma /intrinsic factor required for oral B-12  absorption. This is the most \ncompete product available to support ANS function, especially when the sympathetic side is \ndominant. Consider 2 capsules tid.",

    "text": "Thyroid   - Each capsule contains 300 mg of bovine thyroid obtained from range grazed grass \nfed cattle. I\u2019ll answer your question before you ask it - why is such a high dose of bovine \nthyroid needed to return the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) to a normal level?  The \ncross-species specificity at the thyroid level between bovine and human is weak, therefore \nhigher levels of bovine are needed to archive clinical results. We have found the following \napplications of the product to be effective. TSH levels > 2.5 but < 7.5 one capsule per day. \nFor levels > 7.5 but < 12.5 2 capsules per day, and levels >  1`2.5 but < 20.0 3 capsules per \nday. day is suggested. Thyroid should be dosed in the4 a.m. away from calcium containing \nsupplements. For levels > 20.0 the patient should be examined by a physician qualified to \nmake the diagnosis and provide hormone replacement if needed. Iodine and selenium are \nalmost always needed with thyroid hypofunction. Both can be achieved with KI Plus \nCapsules or Tablets. Both KI Plus Capsules and Tablets contain 200 mcg of selenium per \ncapsule or tablet. Selenium is important as it is the heart of 5\u2019 deiodinase (combination of 2 \nand 3 deiodinase). 5\u2019 deiodinase is the enzyme that is responsible for removing one \nmolecule of iodine from T-4 and adding it to T-3, thus making T-3 the active molecule. \nResults with Thyroid during the clinical trial indicated the product to be not less than 80 \npercent effective at the doses previously indicated.  If the serum thyroid values do not \nimporove when rechecked in 30-45 days, the patient should be referred.\nTomKat \u2013 Four capsules contain a 2580 mg proprietary blend of Indonesian Tongaat Ali root \nextract, Korean Red Ginseng root, Tibullus extract and Maca. Clinical feedback as well as \ncitations from the peer reviewed literature indicates the components of TomKat to be safe \nand effective for increased immune function, reduction of allergic responses, increased \nstamina, increased athletic performance, increased growth, and repair of muscle tissue and \nmost importantly, increased sex drive. If the product is being used to increase sex drive and \nthe patient is overweight, especially in the girdle area, or has an increased total estrogen \n(above the mid-line of the serum value), with a decreased total or free testosterone (below \nthe mid-line of the lab range), then TomKat should be used with Chrysin to reduce the \naromatization of testosterone to estropgen. Consider 4 capsules in the A.M. Product was \ndesigned by Dr. J. Dunn. ",

    "text": "Zinc Orotate \u2013 Each capsule contains 94 mg of fully reacted U.S. manuf actured zinc orotate \nproviding 15 mg of elemental zinc. Why orotate as the mineral salt for zinc? Nieper\u2019s orotates \nare the minerals salts of orotic acid, a natural substance found in the human body as well as \nvarious foods. Based on Nieper\u2019s observations of cells in culture, he concluded, what the \nscientific information supports that orotates can pass through cell membranes intact without \nbreaking apart into their component ions, and thereafter release their respective ions only at \nspecific membranes within the cell. Again, the literature now supports hi s various theories on \norotates. Zinc is required for support of immune function, especially with bacterial and viral \ninfections. It is als o required for production of human growth hormone (HgH) and in the \nadjunctive treatment of hypertension, increased serum lipids, insulin resistance, wound \nhealing, hypogonadism, and in most cases of osteoporosis. Zinc deficiency can be \nascertained via plasma zinc, via the zinc taste  test (ZTT). Zinc defic iency can be assumed \nwhen the alkaline phosphatase is below the midline of the lab range (alkaline phosphatase is \na zinc bearing metalloprotein enzyme), with recurring genital urinary tract infections and with \niron overload (when the serum iron percent of saturation is above 50 percent, and alkaline \nphosphatase below the midline of the lab range, indicating that iron overload is displacing zinc \nreserves). It should also be noted that most allopathic physicians and all the alternative health. \ncare providers suggested zinc supplementation during the Covid 19 pandemic  Zinc Orotate \nproduced and distributed by Zorex International\u00ae is the finest zinc supplement available to the \nhealin g arts. Suggested dose is 1 tid or 1 qid. One qid will provide 60 mg of elemental zinc a \nday and, if used at this level, the \u201c60-6 0 rule\u201d should be consider ed. That is if zinc is used at \n60 mg or more for 60 days or more, serum copper should be checked to determine if \nsupplemental copper is needed. Always consider HCl (HCL Complete) with zinc use. It has \nbeen s hown that HCL at low dose will always increase zinc absorption.  ",

    "text": " \nClinical Applications &  Protocols  \nPrimary Indications  \nAllergic Conditions  The combination of quercetin, vitamin C, and supportive botanicals \ncreates a comprehensive approach to allergic symptom management. Research \ndemonstrates quercetin's effectiveness in mast cell stabilizatio n, reduced histamine \nproduction, and decreased inflammatory cytokine release, while vitamin C accelerates \nhistamine degradation through enhanced diamine oxidase activity.  \nHistamine Intolerance  The porcine liver extract provides natural diamine oxidase (DAO ) \nenzyme support, crucial for individuals with histamine intolerance or DAO deficiency. This \naddresses the root cause of histamine accumulation rather than simply blocking \nhistamine receptors.  \nUpper Respiratory Support  Multi -mechanism approach addresses re spiratory \nsymptoms through quercetin's anti -inflammatory effects on bronchial epithelial cells, \nvitamin C's immune support, and elderberry's immunomodulatory properties for \ncomprehensive upper respiratory management.  \nHepatic Detoxification  Supports liver f unction through multiple pathways including \nenhanced phase I and phase II detoxification, quercetin's hepatoprotective effects, and \nporcine liver extract's support for overall hepatic metabolism.  \nDosing Protocols  \nStandard Allergic Support : 3 capsules three times daily between meals Acute Allergic \nEpisodes : 4 capsules three times daily for 3 -5 days, then reduce to maintenance \nHistamine Intolerance : 3 capsules three times daily with consistent timing for optimal \nDAO support Seasonal Preventi on: Begin 2 -3 weeks before expected allergen exposure \nat 2 capsules twice daily Maintenance Support : 2 capsules twice daily for ongoing \nhistamine regulation  \nTiming Considerations:  \n\u2022 Take between meals for optimal absorption of quercetin and liver extract  \n\u2022 Mai ntain consistent daily schedule for histamine intolerance management  \n\u2022 Consider taking with small amount of fat for enhanced quercetin bioavailability  \n\u2022 Monitor individual response and adjust timing if gastrointestinal sensitivity occurs  \nCombination Strategies  ",

Many of the \nprofessional supplement companies have gone away from glands and organs in their hormonal \nand immune support products. Zorex Internationa l\u00ae does not agree with the removal of glands \nand organs from ,any of th eir prod ucts. We feel they are wrong to neglect the iconic work of \nRoyal Lee, Harrower, Ronzio, Upledger, Goodheart, Issa cs, Murray, Ellis and others concerning \nthe value of organ and glandular therapy. For us, their iconic work has proven to be correct and \nclinically useful with hypo and certain hyper endocrine and organ function, immune insufficiency, \norgan and gland dysfunction, autoimmune problems, and myriad of other conditions. AD \nComplex was designed for and found in clinical trials to be effec tive for primary adrenal \nhypofunction, adrenal hypofunction secondary to anterior pituitary dysfunction, lowered \nresistance fro m long-ter m illness, flu, colds, low blood pressure (use with B6/B1), \nallergy/sensitivity, asthm a, inflammatio n (use with 8X Pancreatin), patients unable to hold a \nmanipulative correction, and sensitivity to bright light (patient/client wears sunglasses indoors). \nConsider 1-2 capsul es in the a.m. and 1-2 at no on.

(Antihistamine  Form ula) \u2013 Three capsules of A.H .F. contains  288 mg of mixed \nascorbates, 6 mg of calcium ascorbate, 150mg of citrus bioflavonoids, 600 mg of quercetin, and \na proprietary blend of ammonium chloride, porcine liver extract,  mangosteen extract, elderberry, \nanise,  fennel, caraway,  Nigella sativa and R eishi.  The heart  of the product is  the alcohol soluble \nextract of porcine liver originally called Anabolin and produced by Harrower Laboratory (Henry \nHarrower, M.D.).  Soon after D r. Harrower\u2019s  death the product was dis continued and the name \nAnabolin was adopted a nd trademarked by a pharmaceutical company fo r an adrenal st eroid.  \nthey were producing. Zorex  International was able to obtain the original formula, produce the \nextract and include it in the A.H.F.  produc t. In Dr. Harrower\u2019s original notes ( An Endocrine \nHandbook),  Dr. Harrower  indicted that Anabolin was available several years before Japanese \nscientists were able to isolate Yakriton, still sold as Antronex. D r. Harrow went on to  indicate that \nAnabolin and Yakriton were nearly identical, but because of the cross - species specif icity of \nporcine to human, the A nabolin performed better as a liver detoxifying a gent and antihistamine. \nA.H.F. i s also effective with allergy (use with Allergy Homeopathic), hepatic detoxification (use in \ncombination with GB Complete and E.N.V./GBLV Homeopathic), upper respiratory problems (use with Immune Plus), and excess mucus production (use with 8X Pancreatin).

These are the amino acids t hat the\nsystem requires to produce nitric oxide (NO), with L-lysine added to help prevent an outbreak\nof herpes due to the L-a rginine component . NO will relax the smooth m uscle of blood vessels\nand enhance circulation.

Arginine Complex a lso stimulates growth hormone\n(HgH) and will increase healing of muscle tissue after exercise.  It helps  to boost metabolism\nand burn fat, speeds wound heal ing, increases thymic function, is effective with some case of\ncystic fibrosis and helps to decrease total and LDL cholesterol.

The \nwater-soluble forms (thiamine HCL, thiamine mono-nitrate, etc.), have their place in the use of \nsupplemental thiamine therapy, however the water-soluble forms have slower absorption, and \nreduced ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, an important factor with serum glucose problems \n(increased or decreased). For this reason(s) many products produced by Zorex International \nwhere increased or reduced serum glucose, inability to get sufficient glucose across the blood-\nbrain barrier, decreased Co2, and increased anion gap, benfotiamine was chosen as the thiamine \ncomponent of several products. With significant thiamine deficiency as seen with acidosis, \ndiabetes, low blood pressure, need for supplemental HCl, reactive hypoglycemia, Benfotiamine is \nalways the best choice. Suggested dose is 1-2 capsules per day.\nBerberine HCL \u2013 Each capsule contains 500 mg of Berberine HCl (99% plus pure berberine \nextracted). Peer reviewed literature and clinical results support Berberine HCl as a natural \nantibiotic, for cardiac support, for its ability to relieve fever and most importantly for its ability \nto reduce A1c. In fact, in  two peer reviewed studies it was as effective in reducing A1c as \nMetformin, without the known side effects associated with Metformin. Product should be used \nwith a broad-s pectrum glucose formula (C.G.F.). Berberine HCl has been effective in majority of \ncases where a broad-s pectrum glucose formula alone was not effective in reducing both fasting \nand post-p randial glucose levels. It should also be noted that beside the product containing a 99 \nplus percent form of Berberine HCl, Zorex Internatio nal was the first company to introduce \nBerberine HCl to the professional healing arts.

Product is gluten free and was not tested on animals. Estriol is increased during pregnancy \nbut has received little or no attention outside gestation. It is well known that pregnancy has immune \nsuppressive effects on many autoimmune problems such as M.S., psoriasis, thyroiditis (Hashimoto\u2019s) \nand rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence exists that estriol has potential benefits for many autoimmune \nproblems. It  has also been used successfully with me nopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, increase \nblood l\nipids, vascular disease, topically for vaginal dryness, and multiple sclerosis. Conventional \nestrogen replacement therapy provides some benefits when a need can be determined through \nbioassay, i\nt is not without certain risks. Estriol has been found to provide most of the benefits of \nconventional estrogen replacement without the known risks. When applied it should be applied to thin \nskin a\nreas such as the chest/breasts, abdomen, inner-arms, or thighs or directly into the vaginal for \nvaginal d\nryness, uterine wall thinning, pain during sexual intercourse and recurring vaginal infections. \nExcept fo r vaginal use, the areas of application should be rotated.

Natural progesterone should \nalways be considered when bioassay indicates that total estrogen is increased. With serum  testing for \ntotal estrogen always consider values greater than the mid- line of the lab range to be elevated. The \nnormal premenopausal pattern for  progesterone secretion during a given month is for the ovaries to \nproduce progesterone in the second two weeks of the menses cycles (day 14 through 28, beginning \nat ovulation and ending at the start of menses). Little progesterone is produced in the following two \nweeks, and this is when it should be used for pre- menstrual females. With post -menopausal females \nand males (especially those under going testosterone therapy), natural progesterone should be \nconsidered for the problems previously noted as well as to help regulate t he production of cortisol, \nprolactin, androgens, and especially to help normalize pituitary and hypothalamus function. Consider \nuse at \u00bd to one full pump once a day or bid. With hot flashed and other symptoms associated with \nmenopause, consideration should be given to using natural progesteron e with Bio-Identical Natur al \nUSP Micronized Estrogen Cream (Estriol) and KI Plus Tablets or capsules. If you are currently using \na topical progesterone product  review the cost, th e amount of natural progesterone per serving, \nchemicals\n the product contains, and the size of the container.

Biotin-D has been found to be helpful adjunctive treatment \nfor supporting neurological functions, helping to steady blood sugar and DNA levels,  and as \nexcellent support for hair, skin, and nail health problems . Since biotin is produced by healthy \nbacteria in the microbiome, patients with small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) , leaky gut \nsyndrome, candida, IBS, et c., should consider boron as adjunctive therapy . Biotin-D should \nalso be considered any time a patient/client is suffering with a bacterial issue in the microbiom e \nor diarrhea secondary to the bacterial infection. Accord ing to the peer li terature, biotin \ndeficiency is a factor in more than 40 percent of females with hair  loss. Biotin is also being used \nby several health care professionals in the adju nctive treat ment of M .S. at 200 mg per day (4 \ncapsules ). High dose Biotin-D will change serum thyroid values but, wil l not change or harm \nthyroid function. Therefore, high dose biotin therapy should be discontinued for 10-14 days \nbefore initiating thyroid testing. With antibiotics  biotin as well as Saccharomycesb Boulardii \nshould be used. The Saccharomyces Boulardii to help replace essential bacteria in the \nmicrobiome and biotin because antibiotics will destroy the bacteria t hat produce biotin. With \nexception of M.

Food grade boron has bee n used successfully in the regulation of estradiol (E -2), \ntestosterone,  free test osterone and has been helpful in decreasing sex hormone binding \nglobulin (SHBG).  Although many professional formulas for osteoporosis  contain boron, the \namount is usually too low. With this  mind, when using a formula for o steoporosis if the total \nboron content is less t han 6 mg, one capsule of Boron should be added to the patient\u2019s \nsupplemental support (there is no known toxic level for boron at supplemental levels up to 20 \nmg per day ). Boron will increase the absorption of calcium, magnesium and vitamin D that are \nnutrients common in the support of os teoporosis . An excellent summary article on the \ntherapeutic uses of boron Nothing Boring About Boron, written by Pizzorno in Integrative \nMedicine, provides over 135 citations from the peer reviewed literatur e on the clinical use of \nboron as boron calcium fructoborinate.

The  average absorption rate of calcium citrat e (Group, Global  \nHealing)   is 39 percent. The others average between 30 and 70 perc ent but, the average \nabsorption rate for calcium orotate is 90 percent ( Global Healing) . This  means lower does can \nbe used to reach therapeutic levels with Calcium Orotate. Calcium  supplementation is often \nindicated with decrea sed serum calcium values (vitamin D deficiency and/or parathyroid \nhypofunction), fever, osteoporosis, certain types of  cancer, protein malnutrition, tooth decay, \ntooth loss with elderly patients, in some cases of GERD, pregnancy, muscle cramps,  cardiac \ninsufficiency and acute pancreatitis.  Like magnesium,  calcium  should be dosed on an empty \nstomach (a.m. and at be dtime) as it will combine with fat in the G. I. and form an insoluble soap \ncausing a reduction in calcium.  The exception to this is with  fever when it should be dosed \nhourly until the fever begins to abat e. For other conditions  consider 3 capsules in the a.m . and \n3-4 at bedtime.",

Product was designed and has worked \nexcellently to ameliorate atherosclerosis and improve circulation. CircuPlus should also be \nconsidered for patients/clients with h igh blood pressure, angina, claudication, erectile \ndysfunction, and other cardiac issues. For all problems described, CircuPlus should always \nbe considered with Arginine Complex, 8X Pancreatin and L.P.A. Plus. What makes this \nproduct different than similar products claiming the same therapy? Cost and ingredients. You \nwill find when you compare cost and ingredients that CircuPlus is the most economical (the \nperson who designed the product did not ask for a commission) and has proven itself to be \neffective in all cond itions described above.

Currently more than eleven million people in the U.S. have age\nrelated macular degeneration (ARMD) and this number is expected to increase to more than\n22 million in the next few years. ARMD is the most comm on cause of blindness in the aging\npopulation.

The product was designed to treat iron \noverload/  hemochromatosis. The  gold standard indicator for iron overload/hemochromatosis \nis a percent of iron s aturation greater than 50.  Although ferritin may also be high, it is  not \ngenerally the best indication (unless over 500) of iron overload or hemochromatosis . Ferritin \nwill also increase above the metabolic level with inflammation, neoplasm, H IV, pr otein \ndeficiency , and myriad of other problem s. Again,  the gold standard diagnosis is a percent of \niron saturation greater than 50. When FE -X is used it should be used with an iron and copper \nfree multiple mineral formula at 2 bid. Fe -X sh ould be considered at 3 bid. If after  45 day s of \nthis therapy if the percent of iron saturation remains greater than 50, gene tes ting should be \ninitiated to determine if the problem is iron overload or hemochromatosis (generally an \ninherited problem). If t he patient is only one gene positive the problem is probably iron \noverload,  however  if the patient is  2 or 3 gene positive the problem is pr obably \nhemochromatosi s. With hemochromatosis all 1st degree relatives of the patient/ client should \nbe contacted because, as pr evious indicated, hemochromatosis is generall y an inherited \nproblem . In any case ph lebotomy  is required and some cases, pharmaceutical support \n(phlebotomy is  always the best choice). In  cases where the serum  ferritin is normal or \ndecreased with and the serum iron is increased this pattern is often associated with zinc \ninsufficiency or copper exc ess. Again, consider Fe-X at 3 bid along with an iron and copper \nfree multiple minerals at 2 bid. Iron overload and hemochromatosis are both silent killers and \nshould never be untreated when discovered via laboratory t esting.  Always rule out zinc \ninsufficiency  (Zinc Orotate) with iron overload.  If the percent of saturation is normal after 45 \ndays on Fe-X, wait 45 days and complete a serial check of the iron percent of saturation. If the percent is again  increased then phlebotomy is needed along with gene testing to rule out hemochromatosis.  Fe-X is not  a long term replacement for phlebotomy . \nGABA -500 \u2013 Each ca psule contains 500 mg of GABA (Gaba-am inobutyric acid).  GABA is \nthe chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human central nervous sys tem. It plays a r ole in \nregulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system.

The acid in the capsule is Betaine HCL and the acid \nextracted from Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, no t the Apple Cider Vinegar as this would be \ndestroyed by the Betain e HCl . That said, we have found the combination of the  two acids \nalong with the other components to provide excellent support for patients/client s with \nhypochlorhydri a. Subjectively hypochlorhydria is seen with bloating or gas shortly after eating, \nheartburn, GERD, vegetarian diets (also rule out vitamin B -12 anemia and iodine need), loss \nof taste  for meat, asthm a, allergies, f ingernails that break or chip easily, and biliary or \npancreatic dysfunction secondary t o hypochlorhydria.  The explanation for secondary  biliary \n(gall bladder) or pancreatic dysfunction is com plex. However, in simple terms , recall that \nwhen the chyme passes through the pyloric cap it must be sufficiently acid (< 2.5) to correc tly \ninitiate cholecystokinin (instructs the gall bladder to release bile) and secretin (instruc ts the \npancreas to release pancreatic bicarbonate) and without sufficient ac idity that chyme is not \nsufficiently alkaline and thus passes through the gut barrier causing systemic acidity which is \nnot correct, and results in the syste m attem pting to alkalinize the chyme with Co2 and alkaline \nmineral s. So, with all this in mind always remember that hypochlorhydria can be nexus to \nbiliary and pancreatic dysfunction.  Without access to Heidelberg Gastro-Telemetry t o \ndetermine hypochlorhydria, blood chemistry can be very useful.  The val ues you will generally \nfind with hypochlorhydr ia are serum gastrin below 45, serum phosphorus below 3.0, tot al \nserum globulin above 2.8 or below 2.2, and MCV greater than 89.9 and/or MCH greater than \n31.9 (both are common  indicators for B -12 need, secondary to HCl nee d). There is a myriad \nof conditions that are nexus to HCl need and although it is not always thought of, always think of treatment of the microbiome (gut) from north to south, and you will find that many problems \nsouth have their nexus in a problem north.  The need for HCl.  (HCL Co mplete)  in both the \nclinical trials, and reported use by many health care providers, has been shown to be the \nmost reliable HCL product available to the health arts.

Much of the peer literature \nindicates that plus II iron is not as well absorbed as plus III forms. However, the literature fails to \nconsider that in the absence of microscopic bleeding, excessive\n menses bleeding, or diets that \nare very low in iron containing foods, the nexus for iron anemia is often due to hypochlorhydria \n(inability to breakdown and absorb iron). Hence the choice to use iron citrate (citrate being acid) \nas the carrier for the iron component. Many will also ask why the product does not contain \nfolate. Although many iron supplements in a tablet or capsule form do contain folate, in a \nproduct that is aqueous (Iron-Plus), folate is not stable, and although the label may list folate as \na component, it was probably there when the product was produce\nd, but bioassay will reveal \nthat it is no longer there 2-4 weeks after the product was prod\nuced. Hence, the lack of folate in \nIron-Plus. Iron-Plus should be considered with iron anemia as seen with a decreased present of \niron saturation, decreased ferritin, and increased total iron binding (TIBC). Subjectively iron \nneed as seen with cold hands and feet, cracks in the fingernails, excess blood loss during \nmenses and iron replacement with hypochlorhydria. It should also be considered with adrenal \ncortical and thyroid hypofunction and with microscopic bleeding until the source of the bleeding \nis discovered and corrected. Iron-Plus should be considered at 1-2 teaspoons full per day or a \nhigher level if a higher need is determined by the health care professional.

    "text": "Lymphatic Drainag e \u2013 Product was developed by Jeffrey Sorna, DiHOM & Harry O Eidenier, III. \nEach four- ounce bottle contains a proprietary blend of distilled water, colloidal silver, zinc, boron \nand electromagnetic isodes. The lymphatic system is part of our immune system that assists our \nvarious systems to protect against disease, inflammation, autoimmune problems, and infections. \nSegments of the lymphatic system  include lymph nodes, plasma cells, the spleen and appendix. \nThe supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is performe d by the blo od and involves a net \nleakage of fluid outward at the capillary level. The principal function of the lymphatic system is to \ngather this fluid and return it to the blood. Congestion interrupts this function and results in \nswelling in the tissues and in most cases lymph edema with resulting inflammation and \ndiminished system function. Ac cording to the literature , lymph edema or congestion (failure to \ndrain) can result in free rad ical problems, cardiac disease, inflammation, and infection. Lymphatic \ndrainage is the forst step in detoxification.Suggested dose is one teaspoon full twice a day. Bottle \nshould be percussed three times before each d ose. \nMagne sium Glycerophosphate Complex \u2013 Each tablet contains 100 mg of elemental \nmagnesium as magnesium glycerophosphate and 10 mg of taurine. M any of you may ask \u2013 why \ndoes Zorex Int ernational have so many different types of magnesium? My answer is, elemental \nmagnesium is elemental magnesium, the different types exce pt for magnesium oxide, which is \nhard to break down, will generally provide results when magnesium deficiency is present. \nHowever, glycerophosphate has the highest bowel tolerance of all the carriers (7 percent, the \nsame as placebo in studies), so it would be the correct choice for a pati ent who needs \nmagnesium, but even small doses (less than the RDA), cause loo se stools or diarrhea. \nMagnesium Glycerophosphate Complex, in addition to being the best choice for patients who get \nloose stools from low  doses, should also be the first choice with muscle contraction and \nrelaxation, for general relaxation, sympathetic dominance (use with Sympathetic Balance with \nsympathetic dominance and I.R.F. with insomnia) glycemic issues (most patients with high blood \nsugar (use with C.G.F.\u00ae ) are magnesium deficient), as well as for patients with epilepsy, \nabnor mal \nheart  rhythm, virus and asthma (magnesium deficiency common with upper respiratory \nproblems) hypochlorhydria (us e with HCL Complete) and adrenal hypofunction (use with AD \nComplex). Dose magnesium to b owel tolerance at bedtime when there is little or no fat present \nin the G.I. (magne sium will bind with fat and form an insoluble soap that significantly reduces \nboth the absorption of fat as well as the magnesium). Oral magnesium, without regard to the \ncarrier, should not be used with renal disease. Consider 4 tablets at bedtime, increasing nightly to \nbowel tolerance. ",

    "text": "Magnesium Orotate 1250 \u2013 Tw o Capsules contain 1250 mg of fully r eacted magnesium \norotate,  providing 86 mgs of elemental magnesium . Only U.S. manufactured orotates  (Nieper \norotates) are used in thi s product.  It is important to ensure the product  you may be using is \nmade with U .S. sourced orotate as  they have never been cited for caus ing hepatic \ninflammation as some p roduced in As ia. have. According to Dr.  Nieper,  who in our opinion, \nwas a genius, indicated that magnesium orotate is useful for patients/clients with M .S., \nrecovery from cardiac disease/attack, heart surgery, to improve athletic performance, and to \nhelp lower elevated ser um lipid levels (use with CircuPlus, L.P.A.  Plus,  Arginine Complex  and \n8X Pancreatin).  There are myriad of clinical uses for magnesium, but  these are the problems \nwhere Magnesium Orotate has out -performed other forms of magnesium.  Many o f you \nbelieve that the serum levels for magnesium are accurate, we do not. W e have  found that \nany value below 2.2 is too low and even those above 2.2 will be found below 6.0, which is the \nlow metabolic level for RBC magnesium.  Altho ugh RBC magnesium is more costl y than \nserum to run, it is much more accurate. Consider six capsules at bedtim e, increasing every \nother  evening until bowel tolerance is reached. If the bowel tolerance is reached at a low level \n(6 capsules or less) then a need for taurine (major carrier of magnesium to the RBC) is \nprobably present and that brings us to the next  magnesium supplement that contains  taurine. \nAlso see Magnesium G lycerophos phate Complex information for patie nts who have a low  \ntolerance to oral magnesium . Magnesium  orotate should not  be used with ren al disease. \nConsider  four capsules at bedtime increasing nightly to bowel tolerance.  \nMagnesium Taurinate \u2013 Each caps ule contains 1000 mg of magnesium taurinate yielding 80 \nmg of elemental magnesium, 720 mg of taurine and 14.4 mg of potassium citrate (5 capsules \nprovide the RDA for m agnesium).  Magnesium  has been found to be a useful adjunctive \ntreatment as a calcium  antagonist (recall that calcium is ubiquitous in nature and \nmanufactured foods, magnesium is not). It should be considered with some cases of  tinnitus, \nas a cofactor to potass ium, fo r vegetarians due to the taurine component, in the treatment \nand prevention of seizures, cataracts (use with (Eye Defense), and as a cof actor to myriad of \nenzymes required for human health.  If your patient/client  continues  to have a low RBC \nmagnesium (below 6.0) taking other forms of magnesium, the problem, can be a taurine \ndeficienc y. Taurine is one of the major carriers in the trans fer of magnesium int o the RBC. \nThis is the patient that will benefit the most from Magnesium Taurinate rat her than \nmagnesium with other carriers. Magnesium Taurinate should also be your \u201cgo to\u201d form or \nmagnesium if the patient has hypertension. Both magnesium  and taurine are considered \nprimary  intervention with hypertension.  Magnesium  taurinate should not be used with renal \ndisease or during pregnancy.  Consider  five capsules at bedtime, increasing by one capsule \nevery  other  evening to bowel tolerance.",

Repeat as needed.\nBurns or cuts: S.O.S. \u2013 3 to 4 capsules tid or more. Expect reduction of the severity of pain and \nsignificantly less scarring. Repeat daily until the wound is completely healed. \nSurgical procedures:  S.O.S \u2013 3 to 4 capsules tid for 3-5 days prior to procedure. \nAfter the procedure, use 3 to 4 capsules tid, until the wound is completely healed. \nOral conditions: (extractions, abscess, and intra-oral sores)\nS.O.S. \u2013 Place 1 capsule directly in the mouth on affected area. Let dissolve and leave the resulting \npaste in place as long as possible. Repeat using 2 capsules for the second dose.\n*Note:  Dental surgical procedures where stitches are placed to close wounds, pay close attention\nas the reduction of healing time can be reduced by as much as 50%. If close attention is not paid,\nthere may have to be another surgical procedure to remove them as the wound may heal over the\nstiches\u2019 entirely.

The \ncross-species specificity at the thyroid level between bovine and human is weak, therefore \nhigher levels of bovine are needed to archive clinical results. We have found the following \napplications of the product to be effective. TSH levels > 2.5 but < 7.5 one capsule per day. \nFor levels > 7.5 but < 12.5 2 capsules per day, and levels >  1`2.5 but < 20.0 3 capsules per \nday. day is suggested.

Iodine and selenium are \nalmost always needed with thyroid hypofunction. Both can be achieved with KI Plus \nCapsules or Tablets. Both KI Plus Capsules and Tablets contain 200 mcg of selenium per \ncapsule or tablet. Selenium is important as it is the heart of 5\u2019 deiodinase (combination of 2 \nand 3 deiodinase). 5\u2019 deiodinase is the enzyme that is responsible for removing one \nmolecule of iodine from T-4 and adding it to T-3, thus making T-3 the active molecule. \nResults with Thyroid during the clinical trial indicated the product to be not less than 80 \npercent effective at the doses previously indicated.

Based on Nieper\u2019s observations of cells in culture, he concluded, what the \nscientific information supports that orotates can pass through cell membranes intact without \nbreaking apart into their component ions, and thereafter release their respective ions only at \nspecific membranes within the cell. Again, the literature now supports hi s various theories on \norotates. Zinc is required for support of immune function, especially with bacterial and viral \ninfections. It is  also required for production of human growth hormone (HgH) and in the \nadjunctive treatment of hypertension, increased serum lipids, insulin resistance, wound \nhealing, hypogonadism, and in most cases of osteoporosis. Zinc deficiency can be \nascertained via plasma zinc, via the zinc taste  test (ZTT). Zinc defic iency can be assumed \nwhen the alkaline phosphatase is below the midline of the lab range (alkaline phosphatase is \na zinc bearing metalloprotein enzyme), with recurring genital urinary tract infections and with \niron overload (when the serum iron percent of saturation is above 50 percent, and alkaline \nphosphatase below the midline of the lab range, indicating that iron overload is displacing zinc \nreserves).

Vitamin D supplementation can reduce respiratory infection risk by up to \n12% overall, with greater benefits in those with deficiency. The therapeutic doses of vitamin C, \nzinc, and vi tamin D work synergistically to enhance immune cell function during active \nchallenges. Vitamin C accumulates in phagocytic cells and enhances chemotaxis, phagocytosis, \nand microbial killing.  \nSeasonal Immune Protection  The formulation supports year -round im mune readiness through \ncomprehensive nutritional support. Vitamin D supplementation with daily doses of 400 -1000 IU \nfor up to 12 months shows protective effects against acute respiratory infections. Zinc deficiency \naffects both innate and adaptive immunity  by preventing T lymphocyte activation and B \nlymphocyte development.  \nRespiratory Tract Support  Multiple nutrients in Immune Plus specifically support respiratory \nhealth and mucosal immunity. Vitamin C may reduce the duration of respiratory infection \nsympto ms including fever, chest pain, and chills. Zinc supplementation significantly reduces \nrespiratory morbidity in children, with studies showing 20.8% vs 45.8% infection rates in \nsupplemented vs placebo groups.  \nRecovery and Convalescence  The comprehensive nu trient profile supports immune system \nrestoration following illness or stress. Zinc is critical for T -cell development and helps the thymus \nregenerate after immune damage. The glandular extracts provide organ -specific support for \nimmune tissue recovery.  \nDosing Protocols  \nMaintenance Support : 1-2 capsules daily with food Acute Immune Challenge : 4-8 capsules \ndaily divided into 2 -3 doses for 5 -7 days Seasonal Protection : 2 capsules daily during high -risk \nperiods Recovery Support : 2-4 capsules daily for 2 -4 week s following illness \nElderly/Immunocompromised : 2-3 capsules daily as ongoing support  \nTiming Considerations:  \n\u2022 Take with food to enhance fat -soluble vitamin absorption  \n\u2022 Divide larger doses throughout the day for optimal utilization  ",

Zinc affects macrophage function, intracellular \nkilling, cytokine production, and phagocytosis. Vitamin D modulates innate immune responses \nand cyt okine production.  \nAdaptive Immune Enhancement  \nZinc supports T lymphocyte activation, Th1 cytokine production, and B lymphocyte \ndevelopment and antibody production. Vitamin C enhances B - and T -cell differentiation and \nproliferation through gene regulating e ffects. Thymus glandular extracts provide peptides that \nsupport T -cell development.  \nMucosal Barrier Function  \nVitamin A maintains epithelial integrity and supports secretory IgA production. Vitamin C \ncontributes to maintaining cellular redox integrity and protects against reactive oxygen species. \nZinc supports mucosal barrier integrity and immune surveillance.  \nAnti -inflammatory Modulation  \nQuercetin, Boswellia, and NAC help modulate inflammatory responses through various \nmechanisms including NF -\u03baB inhibition  and antioxidant activity. Vitamin C protects immune cells \nfrom oxidative damage during respiratory burst activity and inflammatory responses.  \nProduct Specifications  \nActive Ingredients per 4 -Capsule Serving:  \n\u2022 Porcine Thymus: 500 mg (glandular concentrate fr om grass -fed sources)  \n\u2022 Vitamin A (mixed carotenoids): 450 mcg RAE (750 IU)  \n\u2022 Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol): 200 mcg (8000 IU)  \n\u2022 Vitamin C (ascorbic acid): 175 mg  \n\u2022 Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 30 mg  \n\u2022 Citrus Bioflavonoids: 40 mg  ",

    "text": "SIGNIFICANCE  OF CHANGES  IN THE  CONCENTRATION  \nOF BIOLOGICAL MARKERS  \nBlood  Chemistry  \nThere currently is a great deal of resistance to optimum or metabolic ranges on blood chemistry and  \nto conclusions developed by means of  patterning these values. We  agree with the criticism if the \nperson(s) transmitting the information have related the values or patterns as absolute. No diagnostic \nprocedure is absolute,  and we feel none should be used  as the sole means  of making a diagnosis. \nBlood  chemistry, irrespective of  the range used (optima! or reference), is simply a too! to be used \nwith other diagnostic criteria available to the doctor.  \nThe guidelines or  patterns  described in this  manual are  the result of  information gathered between \n1980 and the present on over 10,000 people using what was known as the Biochemical Biopsy, a \nblood  test that used  electrophoretic  methods, colorimetric studies, atomic absorption spectroscopy, \nhormonal  studies and standard hematological  studies. This information was integrated into \ninformation developed from physical examination symptom histories, urinalysis hair mineral \nanalysis, comprehensive stool and digestive analysis and other diagnostic criteria available to the \ndoctors who partic ipated in the gathering of information.  \nMany of the conclusions developed from this project are listed in this manual. As previously stated, \nalthough they cannot be  considered absolute and  are often empirical, we feel that when the \nguidelines  or patterns described  are present,  further investigation is warranted.  \nThe information contained in this manual should not be construed as a claim or representation that \nany procedure or product mentioned constitutes a specific cure, palliative or  ameliorative. Although \nfood supplements and  homeopathic preparations are suggested throughout this manual, the opinions \nexpressed are not those of the manufacturers or their employees. Procedures and products described \nshould be considered as adjunctive to other accepted procedures, deemed necessary  by the attending \ndoctor.  ",

    "text": "1 \n     \n \n \n \n \nSERUM  GLUCOSE  \nBlood  Sugar,  Fasting  Blood  Sugar  (FBS),  Sugar  (Fasting)  \n \nDiscussion:  Glucose levels are influenced by carbohydrate intake, stress, glandular and liver \nfunction.  It is generally true that insulin lowers glucose levels by increasing tissue demand,  while \nhormones produced by the adrenal cortex, thyroid, pancreas, and anterior pituitary tend to increase \nblood sugar levels through their effect on the liver.  All of the  following information is predicated \non a 12 -hour fasting sample.  \n \nRelated Tests:  Urinary glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin (Ale), blood \ninsulin, glucose tolerance test (GTT), HDL, LDL and VLDL  cholesterol, fructosamine (glycated \nalbumin) Co2,  anion gap, plasma glucagon, 2 -hour postprandial glucose and blood pressure.  \n \nReference Range:  Reference ranges vary from different labs however most laboratories indicate \ntheir reference range between 70 and 100 mg/dL.  \n \nOptimum Range:  80 to 95 mg/dL.  Note:  Patients with small or deep veins, a fear of phlebotomy \nor patients having their blood drawn by an inexperienced phlebotomist may experience a slight \nincrease in their fasting blood glucose.  This is based on the stress of the blood draw causing an \nincrease in adrenalin production with a subsequent increase in blood glucose.  The increase should \nbe confirmed or ruled out with serial checks using a glucometer.  \n \nPossible  Alarm  Range:  Below  50 mg/dL  or above  300 mg/dL.  \n \nCommon  Causes  For Increased  Fasting  Glucose:  \n \nDiabetes:  Triglycerides  increased  and often  increased  above  the cholesterol level  when  a \nType IV Hyperlipoproteinemia is present (Metabolic Syndrome), HDL cholesterol generally \ndecreased, hemoglobin Ale increased and/or fructosamine increased, urinary glucose increased, \nCO2 will be decreased with systemic acidity (common with diabetes), plas ma glucagon  increased \n(especially with non -insulin dependent  diabetes), urinary pH decreased and if renal damage is \npresent the BUN, urinary micro -albumin will frequently be increased and the urinary creatinine \nclearance decreased.  Supplemental Support:  C.G.F. (ZI) - 3 tid, SunFlax Complex  (ZI) - 2 \ntid, AD Hyper (ZI)  - 3 bid midday  and in the evening, S.O.S. (ZI) \u2013 2-3 tid,  S y m p a t h e t i c  \nB a l a n c e  ( Z I ) -2  t i d ,  L.P.A.  Plus (ZI) - 2 tid, Berberine HCI  (ZI) - 1 tid and  8X \nPancreatin (ZI) - 1 tid with meals.  Also,  in many cases increasing the tissue demand for glucose \nis helpful (increased tissue demand results in lower circulating glucose levels).  This can often be \naccomplished with Heart Tissue  and Inosito l. Diet:  Use the Roadmap  To Health diet and \nensure the patient drinks at least 8 -10 full glasses of pure water each day.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

    "text": "2 \n Common  Causes  For Increased  Fasting  Glucose  Continued:  \n \nThiamine Insufficiency:  Co2 decreased with  the anion gap increased and red blood cell \nthiamine decreased.  Thiamine is  one of the major nutrients required to transp01i glucose across \nthe blood -brain barrier, hence when  thiamine insufficiency is  present serum glucose may be  high \nbecause of an inability to transport glucose to the brain.  Supplemental support and dietary \nrequirements for thiamine insufficiency are listed in the section of this manual covering carbon \ndioxide. Benfotiamine (fat soluble thiamine) will cros s the blood -brain barrier more efficiently \nthan other  forms.  It is available  in Zorex  International  B6/Bl,  C.G.F.,  CircuPlus  and other \nZorex International  products.  \nDysinsulinism  (Syndrome -X/Metabolic  Syndrome ): Common chemistry changes, \nsupplemental support and diet requirements for dysinsulinism are listed in the section of this \nmanual covering serum triglycerides.  \n \nLess  Common  Causes For Increased  Fasting Glucose:  Myocardial  infarct, brain damage, severe \ntrauma, convulsions, Cushing's disease, acromegaly, severe liver disease, pancreatitis, acute phase \nreactions, adrenal cortical hyperfunction,  both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and  renal  \ndisease.  In every  case of increased  glucose,  inflammation and  mitochondrial  dysfunction  will \nbe present  and is generally  nexus  to the increase.  \n \nCommon  Causes  For Decreased  Fasting  Glucose:  \n \nFasting Hypoglycemia:  Irrespective of  the laboratory range, anytime the  fasting glucose \nis decreased below  80 mg/dL hypoglycemia should be  suspected. However, if  the fasting glucose \nis decreased below 70  mg/dL, hypoglycemia is  almost certain.  In addition to  a decreased fasting \nglucose, LDH will frequently be decreased with fasting hypoglycemia and almost always \ndecreased  with reactive hypoglycemia  (< 150). LDH activity  reflects  active exchange  of chloride  \nwith  glucose  and glucose  with  zinc and sodium  (glycolysis);  therefore,  LDH activity  is \nassociated  with  pancreatic  function  and glucose  metabolism.  Supplemental Support : C.G.F.  \n(ZI) - 2-3 qid between  meals (10:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m., two hours after supper and at bedtime ). If \nthe patient is unable to tolerate these supplements on an empty stomach (between  meals)  dose with  \nmeals and  add one capsule  of HCL Complete  (ZI) - in the  middle of the  meal; Amino  Acid s as \nneeded  to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Note:  Low blood pressure (adrenal cortical \nhypofunction  and thiamine need) is  a common finding with both fasting and reactive \nhypoglycemia. If  present, add AD Complex (ZI)  - 2 in the a.m. and 2 at noon , S.O.S. (ZI) \u2013 2-3 \ntid, and Celtic sea salt to the patient's supplemental  schedule.  Diet:  Use the Roadmap  To Health  \ndiet and ensure the patient  eats three meals per day, does not snack between meals and drinks at \nleast 8 -10 full glasses of pure water  each day.  \nLess Common Causes For Decreased Fasting Glucose:  Pancreatic tumors, extra -pancreatic \ntumors, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), starvation, hypofunction of the anterior \npituitary, severe liver disease, polycystic ovary disease (PCOD), hypothyroidism, improper \nregulation of insulin with insulin dependent  diabetes, alcoholism and anorexia/bulimia .",

    "text": "3 \n Important  Considerations  With Abnormal  Fasting Glucose:  \n \nCraving for sweets  is a common finding with both hypoglycemia and dysinsulinism \n(Metabolic Syndrome).  The craving for sweets can often be ameliorated with GB Complete  (ZI) \n- 2 tid with meals and  C.G.F. (ZI) 2 tid with meals.  \nCarbohydrate sensitivity is a common finding with both decreased and increased fasting \nglucose and is  one of the most important problems that must be addressed with PMS.  \n \nFood allergy testing should be initiated on any patient with increased or decreased blood \nglucose levels.  Food allergy is a common finding with both increased and decreased blood glucose \nlevels.  \nQuercetin bioflavonoids  (Quercetin  - ZI)  are often effective in ameliorating the ocular, \nnerve, and renal degeneration common with long -term increased blood glucose (quercetin will help \nto block glucose infiltration through the sorbitol pathway).  Quercetin is a major sparing nutrient \nfor zinc.  \n \nA five to six -hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) may be required to determine if the  patient \nhas reactive hypoglycemia.  If required, make certain your patient has something to  record their \nsubjective feelings each time blood is drawn.  Often their observations will be as important as  or, \nmore  important than  the laboratory value.  For example, the  hourly value may be within the \nlaboratory range, but the patient advises they were faint, nauseous, etc.  Any of these findings are  \nstrong indications that irrespective of  the laboratory value, the  value was  too low for the patient.  \n \nA \"flat curve\" on a GTT is sometimes seen with hypoglycemia.  The \"flat curve\" is \nassociated with personality disorder, hyperactivity and learning disability and may be due to a \nmetal body burden.  A hair, urine or red blood cell mineral analysis should be  completed to rule \nout toxic element exposure.  \n \nIn general, AD Hyper (ZI) and Sympathetic Balance (ZI)  should be considered with \nincreased glucose or triglycerides (adrenal cortical hyperfunction) and AD Complex (ZI) and \nS.O.S. (ZI)  should be considered with decreased glucose (adrenal cortical hypofunction).  \nIt is now well known that free -radical diseases (especially cancer) can proliferate more \nrapidly in  patients with increased blood sugar (systemic acidosis). Therefore, every effort should \nbe made to normalize blood sugar levels in patients with cancer and other free radical diseases.  \n \nBecause stress (psychological and physical), carbohydrate intake and various other  factors \nwill influence fasting glucose levels,  do not assume hyperglycemia or  diabetes based on  a sole  \nfasting glucose  test. Conduct serial tests to confirm the  increased blood glucose and if  serial tests \nare also increased conduct a hemoglobin Ale  or fructosamine to determine long -term glucose \ncontrol.  If the  fasting  glucose  is greater  than l 08 and  the 2-hour post-prandial  finding  is greater \nthan 199, isolated challenge diabetes is probable.  Confirm with decreased DHEAs.  \n \n \n ",

    "text": "4 \n Important  Considerations  With  Abnormal  Fasting  Glucose  Continued:  \n \nGlucose is an acute phase reactant. Therefore , poor phlebotomy will always result in \na fasting glucose that increased above normal fasting levels.  \n \nMICROALBUMIN  \nMicro -albuminuria  as measured with a 24 -hour urine, 10 -hour overnight urine or spot a.m. urine \n(after initial voiding) is an excellent test to monitor diabetic renal disease including glomerular \ndisease.  With this  test small losses  of protein are  detectable as  micro -albuminuria developing 10 \nto 15 years after the hyperglycemia (or sooner).  With diabetes, micro -albuminuria is generally \nseen before proteinuria  becomes evident  by conventional  urinalysis.  Micro -albuminuria is one of \nthe best available tests for renal disease and should be routinely accomplished along with urinary \ncreatinine clearance on all diabetic patients. As indicated previously, quercetin bioflavonoids \n(AHF - ZI) and general renal support are often effective in ameliorating renal damage seen with \nincreased blood glucose levels.  \n \nC PEPTIDE  \n \nC peptide is a peptide which is made when proinsulin is split into insulin and C peptide.  They split \nwhen proinsulin  is released  from the pancreas  in response to a rise in serum glucose with one C \npeptide molecule for each insulin molecule.  Test is used to determine if the diabetic patient is a \ntype 1 or type 2 diabetic.  The pancreas of a type 1 diabetic is usually unable to produce insulin and \nthey will have  a reduced or  non-existent  level of  C peptide.  The pancreas  of a type 2 diabetic will \ngenerally have  normal or increased levels of C peptide.  The reason that C peptide levels are \nmeasured in lieu of insulin is because insulin concentration in the portal vein ranges from two to \nten times higher than the peripheral circulation where the blood is drawn. Fasting or reactive \nhypoglycemia with a decreased C peptide level is evidence of i nsulin abuse (dietary abuse). See \nAlc for further information on diagnostic uses of C Peptide.  \n \nFRUCTOSAMINE  \nGlycated  Albumin,  Glycated  Proteins  \n \nReference  Range:  0-285 umol/L  - Optimum  Range:  25-250 umol/L  \n \nFructosamine  is used to monitor glucose control over a  shorter period (14 days) versus 120 day \n(erythrocyte average) for Ale  measured at 90 days.  Normal ranges for  fructosamine vary \nconsiderably, however the  normal range  for children is  slightly lower  than for adults.  Because of \nthe short half -life fructosamine is  useful in screening geriatrics, gestational diabetes, juvenile \ndiabetes and patients with abnormal HgB levels and normal fasting glucose levels. This  test \nshould not be completed on patients with decreased serum albumin levels.  ",

Glycated  hemoglobin  values are used to assess long -\nterm glucose control in diabetics, especially patients with insulin dependent  diabetes who's urinary \nand fasting blood glucose levels vary significantly  from day to day.  \nRelated  Tests:  Serum  and urinary  glucose.  \n \nReference  Range:  The laboratory  range  is dependent  upon  methodology;  however,  most \nlaboratories report the normal range at less than 5. 6 percent of the total hemoglobin.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  5.0-5.6 percent  of the total hemoglobin.  \n \nPossible Alarm Range:  The risk of microalbuminuria  with insulin dependent  diabetes increases \ndramatically when the hemoglobin Ale  value is  increased above 8.1 percent of  the hemoglobin.  \n \nCommon  Cause  For Increased  Glycated  Hemoglobin:  \n \nDiabetes:  See serum  glucose.  \n \nCommon  Cause  for Decreased Glycated  Hemoglobin:  \n \nFolate  Deficiency:  folate deficiency is common when A1x < 5.0. Consider C.G.F. (ZI).  \n \nImportant  Considerations  with  Increased  Glycated  Hemoglobin:  \n \nGlycated hemoglobin is an excellent test for determining if the diabetic patient is using \ncorrect dietary controls.  Often the diabetic patient will eat correctly for a few days before they \nknow blood is to be drawn so the doctor will not admonish them about their diet and resulting \nincreased blood sugar level.  Irrespective of their short -term diet, the glycated hemoglobin will still \nreflect their long -term control.  \nGlycated hemoglobin is useful in the evaluation of fetal risk in known diabetics who \nbecome pregnant.  \n \nGlycated hemoglobin is a useful test for predicting the progression of retinopathy and renal \ndestruction.  \n \nAn slightly increased Al c (5-7-5.9) found with a normal serum glucose on serial \nexaminations may be due to an increase in MCV and/or MCH.

    "text": "7 \n BLOOD  INSULIN  \nImmunoreactive  Insulin  \n \nDiscussion:  The earliest molecule of insulin production is proinsulin which is the precursor of \ninsulin.  Proinsulin as well as insulin is secreted by the pancreatic islet beta cells in response to \nglucose ingestion.  Fasting insulin levels and insulin levels drawn during a  glucose tolerance test \n(GTT) are used to determine hypoglycemia or islet cell tumor (insulinoma). Causes of fasting \nhypoglycemia can be due to islet cell tumor, drugs used for glycemic issues, alcohol use, endocrine \nhypofunction (especiall y adrenal, pituitary or thyroid), tumor(s) located in the biliary tree (outside \nthe pancreas) and severe hepatic disease.  \nRelated  Tests:  Serum  glucose,  glycated  hemoglobin  (Ale), fructosamine  (glycated  albumin), \nglucose tolerance test (GTT) , plasma glucagon , and lipid panel.  \n \nReference  Range:  0-24.9 uIU/ml  \n \nOptimum  Range:  3.0- 8.0. \nPossible  Alarm  Range:  Any level  20 percent  or more  above  the laboratory  range.  \n \nCommon Causes For Increased Fasting Insulin:  The most common cause of hyper\u00ad insulinemia \nis obesity. Stimulation and inhibition tests may be required to define whether the increase is due \nto obesity or islet cell tumor. Blood insulin is also frequently increased with Cushing's syndrome, \nwomen on oral contraceptives, hyperthyroidism, patients on exogenous cortical steroids or  \nlevodopa, non -insulin dependent  diabetes, polycystic ovary disease (PCOD), essential \nhypertension, benign neoplasm of the pancreas (insulin increased/glucose decreased), Metabolic \nSyndrome/Syndrome -X and with pituitary hyperfunction  (acromegaly).  \n \nCommon Causes For Decreased Fasting Insulin:  Pituitary  hypofunction, anorexia nervosa, \ngrowth  hormone  deficiency, hypoglycemia and  with glucose tolerance  tests (GTT) when  reactive \nhypoglycemia is present.  Note:  Consideration should be given to ascertaining insulin levels \neach time blood is  drawn for  a GGT and anytime a fasting lipid panel is completed.  \n \nImportant  Considerations  With  Abnormal Insulin:  \n \nThe relationship  of fasting  glucose  to insulin  is critical  in the work -up of insulinoma.  \nCriteria  for insulinoma  are a significantly  decreased  fasting glucose  with hyperinsulinism.  \n \nIt has been shown that pancreatic secretion of insulin is pulsatile, therefore,  to rule out \ninsulinoma  it may  be necessary  to fast the patient for up to 72 hours and draw glucose and insulin \nevery four hours during this period.  \n \nInsulin potentiation therapy (IPT) is  currently being used by many alternative physicians \nas an effective treatment for cancer.  Further information on this  treatment can  be obtained from \nthe American College for  the Advancement  in Medicine . ",

Serum  amylase should always  be confirmed \nwith serum lipase and other tests.  Supplemental support and dietary requirements for patients \nwith pancreatitis can be  found in  the section of  this manual covering serum lipase.  \n \nLess Common Causes For Increased Serum Amylase:  Mumps or other salivary lesions, \nperforated peptic ulcer (with or without pancreatic involvement), intestinal obstruction, biliary \ntract disease usually including stones, appendicitis, diabetic acidosis, trauma, bums, and extra\u00ad \npancreatic cancers (especia lly esophagus, lung and ovary).  \n \nCommon Causes  For Decreased Serum Amylase:  Protein  malnutrition, severe  hepatic  disease \nand alcoholism.  \nImportant  Considerations  With  Abnormal  Serum  Amylase:  \n \nIsoenzymes of  serum amylase can be  completed by most specialty laboratories; however, \nthey are expensive.

Most of the \ninformation relative to  increased or  decreased cholesterol can  be extrapolated to  triglycerides.  In \ngeneral, cholesterol is  increased in most endocrine or  organ hypofunction and decreased in most \nendocrine and organ hyperfunction.  See the section of  this manual covering lipid electrophoresis \nfor more information on  cholesterol.  Note:  Patient condition at  the time of the blood drawing is \nvery important. There should be no  change in  diet for 3  weeks prior to  the test, their body weight \nshould be stable, and they should be fasting (nothing but water for th e 12 hours preceding the test). \nFasting is not as important with cholesterol as it is with triglycerides; but since they are generally \ndrawn together fasting becomes an important issue.  Posture may also be  significant in that \ncholesterol may be from 10 to 15 percent lower after 20 minutes in the recumbent position and \nincreases of up to 5 percent are possible if  the tourniquet is  applied for more than 2 minutes during \nthe draw.  Emotional and physical stress can  also influence cholesterol levels (cholesterol  is an \nacute phase reactant) therefore, when stress is present, cholesterol is generally increased above the \npatient's normal level.  \nRelated Tests:  Serum triglycerides, HDL/LDLNLDL cholesterol, lipid fractionization, serum \nglucose, hemoglobin A le, fructosamine, apolipoprotein A -1, B and E, lipoprotein (a), plasma \nglucagon, blood insulin, the thyroid panel and salivary, serum, or urinary cortisol.  \nReference  Range:  0-20 years  of age: 100-169 mg/dL  \n21-99 years  of age: 100-199 mg/dL  \n \nOptimum  Range:  150-220 mg/dL.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Although  only a fraction  of the  patients  with serum  cholesterol  above \n275 mg/dL have coronary artery disease, values above 275 mg/dL require immediate attention.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for Increased  Serum  Cholesterol:  \n \nCoronary  Artery  Disease:  See the section  of this manual  covering  HDL  cholesterol.  \n \nDiabetes:  See the  section of  this manual  covering  serum  glucose.  \n \nPrimary  Thyroid  Hypofunction  or Hypofunction  Secondary  to Anterior  Pituitary  \nHypofunction:  See the section of this manual covering thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).  \n \nLess  Common  Causes  for Increased  Serum  Cholesterol:  Adrenal  cortical  dysfunction,  Type \nII, II -A, II -B, III and V Hyperlipoproteinemia, alcoholism, liver necrosis, pancreatitis, renal \ndisease, and hypertension.  \nNote:  For most patients lowering dietary cholesterol will generally have little  effect on decreas\u00ad \ning serum  cholesterol. Addressing other  factors  such as exercise, caffeine consumption, smoking, \nobesity, excessive carbohydrate consumption, endocrine and liver/biliary function will have a \ngreater effect on lowering cholesterol than lowering cholesterol  in the diet.

Decreased cholesterol can  be \nnormal for a vegetarian and some people with a genetic predisposition to decreased cholesterol. \nUsing electrophoretic studies, hormonal panels, glycoprotein electrophoresis, the CBC with \ndifferential and other bioassay, we were able to  confirm on over 500 cases that were later diagnosed \nwith neoplasm, that decreased cholesterol for  a patient who historically had normal or increased \ncholesterol was a strong diagnostic indicator for neoplasm.  This was especially true when the \nlymphocyte percentage was below 20 percent and the serum albumin was below 4.0 g/dL.  When \ncholesterol is considered correctly (functionally) as not only a risk factor for coronary artery \ndisease, but  also as  a precursor to  hormone production, as  a protective coating on cells, membranes, \nand organisms and as  a cell recognition factor in  the immune process, one can see why cholesterol  \nis as dangerous low as it is high.  \nImportant  Considerations  with  Abnormal  Serum  Cholesterol:  \n \nBiliary stasis may occur with increased serum cholesterol (cholesterol content of the bile \nis too high). With most cases this problem is diagnosed with subjective indicators.

A patient who is correctly metabolizing their fats, proteins and carbohydrates will \ngenerally have about half as much triglyceride as cholesterol.  Example - if the serum cholesterol \nis 200 the triglyceride level should be around 100.  Classic research from the Framingham studies \nin the 1970s identified high serum cholesterol as a heart disease risk factor (above 200 mg/dL); \nhowever  subsequent Framingham studies as well as other peer reviewed studies (Helsinki, etc.),  \nindicated that increased triglycerides in  conjunction with decreased HDL cholesterol (Metabolic \nSyndrome/Syndrome -X) was a more significant indicator for coronary arte1y disease than high \nserum cholesterol alone. The following is  based on a fasting sample.  \nRelated Tests:  Serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDLNLDL cholesterol, serum glucose, \nhemoglobin Ale, fructosamine, apolipoprotein A -1, B and E, lipoprotein (a), plasma glucagon, \nLipid Fractionization test, blood insulin, the thyroid panel and cortisol.  \n \nReference  Range:  Below  149 mg/dL.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  Between  40 and 60 percent  of the total cholesterol.  \n \nPossible Panic Range:  Above 250 mg/dL is a  cause for concern, above 400 mg/dL is a certain \ncause for concern; in either case a Lipid Fractionization test is indicated.  \nCommon  Causes For  Increased  Serum  Triglycerides:  \n \nDysinsulinism (Metabolic Syndrome/Syndrome -X): Glucose is frequently increased \nabove 95 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol  decreased, LDLNLDL  cholesterol increased, triglycerides will \nfrequently be increased above the  total cholesterol (Type IV Hyperlipoproteinemia),  cortisol is  \nfrequently increased, blood insulin is  frequently increased, lipoprotein (a)  is increased and the \napolipoprotein  A-1 to B ratio is generally  weighted  to the B side.

They are typically  75 percent triglyceride  and 25 percent protein, \ncholesterol and phospholipids.  If chylomicrons are present in a fasting sample (8 -12 hours) a \npathological  process is almost certain and this process may be genetic.  \n \nThe Pre-Beta Region:  This region is  about 80 percent triglyceride with protein, cholesterol \nand phospholipids making up the remaining 20 percent.  On the  tracing if  a split (double or triple) \npeak is  seen in this  region, the split suggests the presence of a pathological process.  Most often this \nwill occur with an autoimmune phenomenon or a cardiovascular problem.  A split pre\u00ad beta \ncombined  with an increase of  CPK (CK) is suggestive  of a cardio -pulmonary problem.  \n \nThe Beta Region:  This region is about 50 percent cholesterol  with protein, triglyceride \nand phospholipids making up the remaining 50 percent.  \n \nThe Alpha  Region:  This region  is about  60 percent  phospholipids  (HDL  cholesterol) \nwith LDL cholesterol and triglyceride making up the remaining 40 percent.  \n \nCommon  Types  of Hyperlipoproteinemia:  There  are several  subtypes  of \nhyperlipoproteinemia, however the following five are the major types generally seen:  \n \nType I:  This is the type of lipid disorder where the patient lacks the ability to clear \nchylomicrons from the plasma. Frequently this is  a familial problem and  along with  the increased \nchylomicrons  the patient  will geue1ally have  an increased triglyceride  level  and frequently a  split \npre-beta region indicating the presence of a pathological process.  \nType II:  Characterized by an increase in  the beta region with an increase in total serum \ncholesterol.  The pre -beta region and triglycerides will be normal and the alpha region will be normal \nor increased.  If the Type II problem involves hepatic or pancreatic dysfunction, the  alpha region \n(HDL cholesterol) will be depressed.

The alpha region (HDL  cholesterol)  will be normal or \ndepressed.  Patients  with Type III commonly  suffer from premature coronary artery disease that \ncan be confirmed with the isoenzymes  of CPK (CK) and LDH (LD).  \n \nType IV: This is the most common pattern encountered with lipid electrophoresis.  It is \nfrequently associated with diabetes or pre -diabetes, atherosclerosis, primary thyroid hypo\u00ad function \nor thyroid hypofunction secondary to anterior pituitary hypofunction, carbohydrate sensitivity, \ndysinsulinism (Metabolic Syndrome/Syndrome -X), hepati c dysfunction and genetic predisposition. \nWith Type IV the total triglycerides will be quantitatively increased in compar\u00ad ison to cholesterol.  \nThe serum cholesterol may be no rmal, but the triglycerides will always be nearly as high or higher \nthan the total cholesterol.  \n \nType V:  Type V is seen with acute metabolic disorders such as uncontrolled diabetes, acute \npancreatitis, alcoholism and pathological liver/biliary  or renal disease.  The pre -beta and beta \nregions will be significantly  increased with a depression in the alpha region.  \n \nImportant  Considerations  with  Serum  Lipids:  \n \nLipids are not water -soluble  and biologically they  serve several different  functions such as \nstructural components for membranes, storage and transport forms for energy fuels and metabolism, \nprotective coating on cells and membranes and tissue immunity as cell recognition factors.  \n \nAfter reviewing several thousand lipid panels and following many of  the patients for  over \nten years, we have  arrived at  the following general conclusions. This information is not absolute; \nhowever in the majority we feel it is correct.  \n \nWhen patients are properly utilizing their fats, proteins and carbohydrates, the tri\u00ad \nglyceride  level will  be between 40 and 60 percent of the total cholesterol.  For example, if the total \ncholesterol is 200 mg/dL, the triglyceride level should be between 80 and 120 mg/dL.  \n \nThe patient with decreased triglycerides in  relation to  the total cholesterol is  not at \ngreat risk  for cardiac destruction;  however,  this pattern is  common with an  autoimmune  problem.  \n \nThe patient with increased triglycerides in relation to total cholesterol and decreased \nHDL cholesterol is  at high risk for cardiac destruction.

Supplemental Support:  \nRiboflavin  300 (ZI) \u2013 1 daily and Power Pill (ZI) \u2013 1 daily  (riboflavin and thiamine generally \nreduce with  renal disease, especially with low  protein diets), SunFlax Complex (Zl)  - 2 tid, C.G.F. \n(ZI) 3 tid, Renal  support product , Potassiu m and Chinese Rhubarb (as directed by the \nmanufacture) . Diet:  Eliminate citrus (except lemon), dairy products, gluten, alcohol, processed \nfoods, hydrogenated fats and oils, refined carbohydrates and caffeine containing foods from the \ndiet. Use a high complex carbohydrate diet (fruits and vegetables) until the renal dysfunction \nresolves. Note:  The above supplements and diet are indicated for chronic renal dysfunction. Acute \nrenal failure requires immediate medical attention and probable hospitalization.  If the infection is \nreoccurring always add Zinc Orotate - 1 qid.  ",

Additional supplemental support and diet requirements  will \nbe determined by the locus (cardiac, renal, allergy, etc.).  \n \nBUN increased above 25 mg/dL generally indicates renal dysfunction, however if the \ncreatinine is not increased the BUN increase may be due to hypochlorhydria or dehydration.  \nIn many cases, skin  problems of  unknown origin can  be due to renal dysfunction (kidneys \nare not processing waste correctly and the skin is being used as a secondary organ to eliminate \ntoxins from the system).  \n \nKidney Stones (Renal Calculi)  will often cause an increase in BUN, serum creatinine \nand/or abnormal serum electrolytes however, in many cases these tests will be normal. Irrespective \nof the blood values, if a  known problem with kidney stones (renal calculi) is present (subjective \nindications or identification through urinalysis), the following supplemental support and diet \nrequirements should be employed:  KI CAPS (ZI) - 1 daily B6/Bl  (ZI) - 1 tid and Magnesium \nGlycerophosphate Tablets (ZI) - at bedtime to b owel tolerance.

    "text": "31 \n SERUM  CREATININE  \n \nDiscussion:  Creatinine is a waste product formed by spontaneous decomposition of creatine which \nis an intrinsic substance required in the contraction of muscle; therefore patients with increased \nmuscle mass may have slightly higher creatinine levels and patients with decreased muscle mass \n(children, older  adults,  men and women with below average muscle mass)  will have slightly lower \nlevels of  creatinine.  Because of  increased glomerular filtrations rates,  creatinine is also slightly \nlower than normal during pregnancy. Creatinine differs from BUN in that it is generally not \ninfluenced by protein intake or sex and is not influenced by conditions that cause excess protein \nbreakdown.  Note:  Concentration of creatinine only becomes significantly abnormal when one -\nhalf or more of  the kidney nephrons have stopped functioning.  Thus, serum creatinine is not as \nsensitive an indicator of early renal disease as BUN which increases more rapidly than serum \ncreatinine in the early stages of renal disease. Sexual activity, bic ycle riding and golf should be \navoided for 72 hours prior to running the PSA.  \nRelated Tests:  BUN, serum uric acid, urinary uric acid, blood electrolytes, liver enzymes, urinary \ncreatinine clearance, urinary micro -albumin, serum albumin, serum calcium, HDL cholesterol, \nHCT/HGB, WBC, serum phosphorus, C -reactive protein, PSA and free PSA.  \n \nReference  Range:  Female  .59-1.04 mg/dL;  Male  749-1.35 mg/dL.  Children,  geriatrics  and \npatients with below average muscle mass may normally have a value <  .49. \n \nOptimum  Range:  Same  as laboratory  range.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Above  2.5 mg/dl  indicates  a serious  metabolic  problem.  \n \nCommon  Causes  For Increased  Serum  Creatinine:  \n \nChronic  Renal  Dysfunction:  See the section  of this manual  cove ring BUN  for \nlaboratory changes, supplemental support and diet requirements.  \nRenal Hypertension:  See the section of this manual covering renal hypertension listed \nunder blood urea nitrogen (BUN).  \nBenign Prostate Hypertrophy:  PSA, free PSA and some of  the serum tests for prostate \nthat are still under investigation,  may be normal or  abnormal and  all other renal indicators (BUN, \nuric acid, electrolytes, etc.) may be normal. However, if the creatinine is at 1. 4 or higher for a \nnormally muscled male over 40 years of age, prostate hypertrophy should be ruled out  via a \nmanual exam of the prostate (males with increased muscle mass frequently run levels that are \nnormally > 1.4). Often  the creatinine will increase long before the  PSA/free PSA changes occur. \nProstate hypertrophy can be confirmed by an increase in LDH isoenzyme #4, increased monocytes, \nmicroscopic examination of the urine for prostate cells, a urinalysis indicating infection and/or the \nmost accurate test which is a m anual examination of the prostate.  Also, several subjective \nindications may be present s uch as frequent urination, loss of sex drive, inability to maintain an \nerection, pain on the inside of the ankles and urinary incontinence.

    "text": "33 \n BUN/CREATININE  RATIO  \nUrea  Nitrogen/Creatinine  Ratio  \n \nDiscussion:  The BUN/Creatinine ratio is useful when assessing patients with chronic renal \ndysfunction . However , the ratio may be skewed when a high normal BUN is present with a low \nnormal creatinine or a high normal creatinine with a low normal BUN.  Therefore, the ratio is \ngenerally  not as valuable diagnostically as the quantitative BUN and creatinine.  \n \nRelated  Tests:  BUN  and serum  creatinine.  \n \nReference Range:  Ranges vary from laboratory to  laboratory however, most laboratories report \nthe reference as between 10 and 22.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  10 to 15. \n \nPossible  Panic Range:  Ratios> 30 strongly  suggests  serious renal dysfunction.  Ratios> 36 also \npoint to  serious renal dysfunction but, can also indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding.  \n \nCommon  Causes  For An Increased  BUN/Creatinine  Ratio:   Congestive  heart  failure, \nintestinal bleeding, shock, hypotension, dehydration and renal disease.  \nCommon Causes For A Decreased BUN/Creatinine Ratio:  Low protein diets, malnutrition, \npregnancy (normal), inappropriate secretion of anti -diuretic hormone, certain drugs (cimetidine, \nand trimethoprim) and with antibiotic use.  \n \nImportant  Considerations  With  An Abnormal  BUN/Creatinine  Ratio:  \n \nInappropriate secretion of anti -diuretic hormone can be due to posterior pituitary dys\u00ad \nfunction and if present the patient will also frequently have sensitivity to certain foods and to odors \n(perfume, exhaust gas, etc.).  \n \nGLOMERULAR  FILTRATION  RATE  \nGFR  \n \nGFR is the rate at which an ultra-filtrate  of plasma  is produced  by glomeruli  per unit of time.  It \nis an  estimate of  the number of functioning nephrons or  functional renal mass.  The GFR can be \ncalculated by several methods but  is generally calculated from the serum creatinine and BUN, the \npatient's age, gender, height and weight and race are used in the calculation.  Although a decreased \nGFR is  an indication of reduced filtering capacity of the kidneys it  is not as  accurate a marker for \nrenal function as a urinary creatinine clearance and micro -albumin.  Therefore, when the GFR is \ndecreased  more than 10 percent  below the laboratory  range, a creatinine clearance and  micro -\nalbumin shou ld be considered.

It is stored \nin the kidneys,  hence the increase along with BUN and creatinine  in renal disease. Reduced oxygen \nlevels will activate xanthine oxidase with the end product of xanthine oxidase activation being uric \nacid.  Therefore, reduced oxygen levels will result in increased uric acid levels.  Although purines \n(pork, organ meats, shellfish , legumes, etc.) will increase serum u ric acid, stress and inflammation \nare the most frequent findings with increased uric acid.  \nRelated Tests:  Serum creatinine, BUN, urinary uric acid, blood electrolytes, liver enzymes, \nMCV/MCH, sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein, gamma globulin, rheumatoid factor, ANA, \nfood allergy testing, metal body burden analysis (RBC, hair, urine), urinary micro -albumin  and \nurinary creatinine clearance.  \n \nReference  Range:  Males  - 3.7 to 8.6 mg/dL  (serum)  \nFemales -2.5 to 7.1 mg/dL  (serum)  \nMales  and Females  - 250 to 750 mg/24  hour urine.  \nNote:  An increase  in serum  uric acid during  childhood  is normal.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  Males - 3.5 to 5.9 mg/dL  (serum).  \nFemales  - 3.0 to 5.5 mg/dL  (serum).  \nNote:  For urine  uric acid use the laboratory  range.  \n \nPossible Panic Range:  Values< 3.0 mg/dL generally indicate either a chronic vitamin B -12 or \nmolybdenum need and values> 9.0 mg/dL indicate severe hyperuricemia and require immediate \nattention.  \n \nCommon  Causes  For Increased  Serum  Uric  Acid:  \n \nGout:  Liver enzymes will be increased in the acute phase, serum creatinine increased, \nurinary creatinine clearance decreased, serum phosphorus decreased, white blood count  increased,  \nserum  triglycerides  increased  in more than 75 percent  of the cases,  CRP  increased, and  BUN  \nincreased  with renal  failure,  however  the changes  in BUN  may be slow.

Use the Roadmap To Health diet and ensure the \npatient drinks at least 8 -10 full glasses of pure water daily. Note:  One of the commonly missed \nproblems resulting in rheumatoid arthritis is systemic amoebas or an overgrowth of amoebas in the \ndigestive tract.  Regardless of where they reside, they can up regulate the immune system either \nfrom direct exposure of the organisms to inflammatory mediators or through the effects of the \nendotoxins produced by the amoebas.  Of course, since amoebas are  commonly found in  the \nenvironment (especial ly the  soil), it  seems  that based on  the above mechanism, that everyone \nshould have rheumatoid arthritis.  The answer to  this quandary is, in the healthy individual both the \namoebas and the toxins they produce pass through the digestive tract and are eliminated in the feces \nwithout being absorbed or generating an inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa.  However, \nsince most rheumatoid patients have increased gut permeability or  \"leaky gut\", either the  organisms \nor their toxins are  easily absorbed with the resulting autoimmune response.  \n \nSmall Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is frequently present with rheumatoid \nconditions.

Supplemental Support:  Increase pure water intake to not less than 8 -10 full  \nglasses  daily and if  the patient  is unable  to maintain  the water  (frequent urination)  add S.O.S. (ZI) \n\u2013 3 tid, L-Glutamine  \u2013 as directed by the manufacturer,  and 1 teaspoon daily of Hydrate \nII (ZI), to increase cellular hydration.  If the patient requires sodium add one teaspoon of Celtic \nSea Salt daily to their diet.  \n \nLess Common Causes For Increased Total Serum Protein:  Diabetes, adrenal cortical \nhypofunction, several types of cancer, liver/biliary dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis, amino acid \nneed , and hypochlorhydria.  Total protein is a combination of albumin and total globulin.  \nTherefore, when the total protein is  increased, the cause may be due to  an increase in  total globulin \ntherefore the nexus for the increase is either hypochlorhydria  or an increase in alpha 1,  2, beta or \ngamma globulin.

With total serum protein decreased, albumin, serum calcium, HGB, HCT,  total WBC and \nBUN  may also be decreased.  Supplemental  Support :  protein  powder.  Diet:  Excess \ncarbohydrate consumption and/or combining proteins with carbohydrates are often the major \nreasons for hypochlorhydria which results in protein malnutrition/amino acid need.  Therefore, \nelimination of refined carbohydrates,  gluten, dairy and packaged foods and meals that combine \nprotein with carbohydrate is paramount to the patient's recovery.  If hydrochloric acid \nsupplementation is required (see total serum globulin for laboratory changes) add HCL Complete \n(ZI) - 2 tid in the middle of the meal, increase to  stomach tolerance. If more than 4 capsules are \nneeded, rule out zinc, thiamine and salt deficiency.  \nDigestive Inflammation (Leaky Gut Syndrome, Gastritis, Colitis, Ileitis, Crohn's  \nDisease, JBS, Etc.):  Albumin decreased, serum phosphorus decreased, serum gastrin increased, \nHCT and HGB decreased, MCV and MCH normal to increased. With gastric inflammation, a need \nfor vitamin B -12 and folate is almost always present (complete a urinary or serum methylmaloni c \nacid and homocysteine), gamma globulin increased, basophils increased, potassium decreased, \nALP intestinal isoenzyme increased with ulceration/erosion.  Diet:  Drink  at least 8  full glasse s of \npure water daily,  increase fresh  vegetables; but  avoid  lettuce and  foods  in the cabbage family until \nthe flatulence and diarrhea are under control. Use skinless poultry and fish in lieu of red meat.  \nEliminate all dairy products and gluten.  Eliminate all refined carbohydrates,  alcohol and caffeine.  \nConsider foods high in  fiber; but do not use grains.  Do not use fruit juice, use only freshly squeezed \nvegetable juice and ensure the juice is diluted by 50% with pure water.  Supplemental Support:  \nFirst detox the patient,  use the Roadmap To Health diet, C.G.F. (ZI)  \u2013 2-3 tid,  GI Complex  \n(ZI) \u2013 2-3  t i d ,  Saccharomyces boulardii  (ZI) - 1 bid and 8X Pancreatin  (ZI) - 2 bid with \nfood. After the patient  begins to form a normal stool and the bleeding (if  present) has stopped, \nreduce the above supplements by 50%. Note:  If the subjective indications of biliary dysfunction \nand hypochlorhydria are still present after the patient begins to form a normal stool add HCL \nComplete  (ZI) - 2 capsules in the middle of the meal, increase to stomach tolerance and GB \nComplete  (ZI)- 2-3 tid.  \n \nLess Common Causes For Decreased Serum Total Protein:  Thyroid hyperfunction, adrenal \ncortical hyperfunction, thiamine deficiency, congestive heart failure, hypertension and chronic \nrenal dysfunction.

An increase or decrease in any of these fractions (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta and/or \ngamma) will cause an increase or decrease in the total globulin.  For this reason, care must  be \ntaken  when  making  a diagnosis  based  upon  the total  globulin  alone.  Total  globulin is useful \nwith other tests for assessing degenerative, inflammatory and infectious processes and wit h BUN, \nserum phosphorus, serum gastrin, urinary indican, subjective indicators and other  tests located \nbelow to confirm a need for HCl.  \n \nRelated Tests:  Albumin, A/G ratio, serum total protein, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), \nserum gastrin, liver enzymes, sedimentation rate, WBC and differential, alpha 1 glycoproteins, \nBUN, urinary indican, C -reactive protein, CEA and other tests used to  confirm neoplasm.  \n \nReference  Range:  Most  laboratories  indicate  the reference  range  between  2.0 or 1.5 and \n4.5 g/dL.  \n \nOptimum Range:  2.4-2.7 g/dL. Note:  Total globulin values below 2.4 or above 2.7 suggest a need \nfor HCl or digestive inflammation secondary to a need for HCl.  The need for HCl or the presence \nof digestive inflammation  secondary  to a need for HCl should always be confirmed with subjective  \nindications such as loss of taste for meat, gas, bloating, bad breath, etc.  \n \nPossible Panic Range:  Below 2.0  or above 3.5 g/dL.  Anytime the  total globulin is below 2.0 or \nabove 3.5, consideration should be  given to  completing a  serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) to \nascertain the location of the increase or decrease.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for Increased  Total  Serum  Globulin:  \n \nHypochlorhydria:  Serum phosphorus decreased below 3.0, serum gastrin < 45, total \nprotein  normal  to decreased,  MCV increased above  89.9 with the MCH  sometimes increased \nabove  31.9,  BUN  increased,  serum  calcium, serum iron  normal  to decreased,  CO2  decreased and \nanion gap increased (thiamine need resulting in the inability to produce HCl), serum, chloride \ndecreased, alkaline phosphatase decreased (zinc need resulting in the inability to produce HCl) \nand a positive zinc taste  test (ZTT). Always confirm hypochlorhydria  with the common \nsubjective indications (gas, bloating, loss of taste for protein, etc.).  Supplemental  Support:  \nHCL Complete (ZI) - Taken in the middle of the meal at the level required to eliminate the \nsubjective indications (increase until the supplement causes a  slight burning in the stomach and \nthen begin to reduce).  If more than 4 capsules are needed, rule out zinc, thiamine and salt \nneed.  Diet: Use the Roadmap To Health diet and ensure the patient drinks at least 8 -10 full \nglasses of water each day.  Note:  When hypochlorhydria is present, pancreatic and/or biliary \ndysfunction is  also generally present secondary to  the need for HCl (acidity of the chyme triggers \nthe release of cholecystokinin and secretin).

Both protein putrefaction and carbohydrate fermentation will be \npresent with HCl need as well as biliary and pancreatic insufficiency.  \n \nAccording to Louis Rubel, M.D. (The G.P. and the Endocrine Glands) serum globulin will \nincrease in protein malnutrition and HCl need for the following  reason:  Albumin is  formed in the \nliver and is the supply of available protein to the body cells.  As serum albumin is withdrawn from \nthe peripheral cells in order to maintain an adequate supply of available protein in  the blood stream \nglobulin, which is  a larger molecule, it  is also pulled from the protoplasm of the peripheral cells. \nHence; there is a rise in the serum globulin levels.  Dr. Rubel indicated that when the serum globulin \nlevel was  at 3.0 g/100 mL,  or higher, the need for HCl supplementation and additional protein in \nthe diet was certain.  Later research, using the Biochemical Blood Biopsy, i ndicated that Dr. Rubel's \noriginal research was probably conservative concerning increased globulin levels.

    "text": "53 \n Important  Considerations  with  Abnormal Serum  Gamma  Globulin:  \n \nIgA, IgG,  IgM,  IgD and IgE are all fractions  of the total gamma  globulin.  \n \nIgA normally  accounts for about 12 percent of the total gamma globulin.  This fraction may \nbe estimated from the degree of depression on the serum protein electrophoresis graph between \nbeta and gamma globulin.  IgA contains anti -toxins, anti -bacterial agents and isoagglutins. It is \nincreased in hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, food sensitivity and moderately increased with \ninflammation.  \nIgG normally  accounts for about 85 percent of the total gamma globulin. It is best estimated \nby the peak slightly to  the right of  center of  the total gamma globulin region as  seen on the serum \nprotein electrophoresis graph.  Increases are seen with chronic inflammation, food sensitivity and \nproliferative disease such as pneumonia, T.B., cystitis, collagen disease, mononucleosis, hepatitis \nand some cases of intestinal parasites.  These elevations should not be confused with a monoclonal \ngammopathy (graph indic ates more than one gamma peak).  \n \nIgE plays an important role in allergic response.  This protein is found in very low \nconcentrations  in the serum and is also found on circulating basophils and mast cells (mast cells \nare a primary carrier for histamine).  It is increased in allergy/sensitivity and parasites.  \n \nIgM and IgD will generally increase and decrease along with IgG in relation to \ninflammation.  \n \nOrganic EFAs (SunFlax Complex ( ZI) or Pumpkin Seed Oil (ZI) and thymus Immune \nPlus (ZI)  are generally effective for increasing gamma globulin.  This is especially true with \nchildren who suffer with chronic immune deficiency problems and inner ear infections.  ",

On the following  pages  we will limit our discussion  to those  fractions  widely  used,  \nalpha  1, alpha  2, beta  and gamma  globulin  and their  components, the  specific  globulins of  the total \nprotein complex.  \n \nWhen ordering a serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) always request the  tracing and if  possible \nrequest  the laboratory  complete  the SPE manually.  The shape  and form  of the curves (see the \npages that f ollow for examples of abnormal patterns) will often provide valuable  diagnostic \ninformation  not available from quantitative information alone. The  shape and form of the curves are  \nmuch easier to see and interpret  on a tracing that  has been completed  manually.  \n \nElectrophoresis is essentially a study of the migrating characteristics  of charged particles through \nconducting solutions in a controlled  voltage field.  On the graph, changes  in particle migration \ncharacteristics  are seen as slurring, bridging,  etc. That is, a portion of  the protein may be  slightly \naltered by metabolic dysfunction  and will then migrate at a slightly different speed.  The affected \nmolecules  will be seen on the densitometer  graph  as a change  in the expected  peak,  slurring  of one \npeak into the following peak,  a dual peak rather than  a single peak, etc.  \n \nOn the tracing, the slowest  migration of  molecules is  in the  gamma region and the  fastest is  in the \nalbumin region.  \n \nWith the exception of the albumin fraction of the SPE the graph can generally be viewed as a \nrepresentation of inflammation and destruction in body  tissues . Elevations in the gamma region \nrepresent primarily inflammation and elevations in the alpha  1 region represent primarily \ndestruction (exception - the alpha l  globulin  will elevate in severe inflammation).  This observation \nindicates  that molecules resulting from inflammation  migrate more slowly than  molecules  from tissue \ndestruction . \n \nThe following  chart indicates  the average percentage of tissue inflammation  and destruction seen \nwith elevations  in the alpha  1, alpha  2, beta and gamma  regions.  Here  we are speaking  of the \npercentage  of protein  molecules  above  the normal  level,  not the ratios  of normal  protein \nconcentration or the percentage of patients who represent elevations in these various regions with \ntissue inflammation or destruction.  Simply stated, elevations in  the gamma region are generally  \ndue to inflammation and elevations in the  alpha  1 region are generally due to destruction.  Neither  \n inflammation nor destruction  of the tissue can be found alon e, inflammation always has some \ndestruction present and  destruction always has some infl ammation present.",

Tissue inflammation represents \nan increase in antibody production in response to an antigen challenge.  \nProtein released  into the  blood stream  by malignant_ tissue generally  contains a higher carbo -\u00ad hydrate \ncontent (hexose, a six carbon sugar), than do proteins from non-malignant  tissue. Therefore,  \nmalignancy  will almost  always  produce  elevations  in the alpha -I and occasionally in the alpha -2 \nregion.  By using  the alpha  l glycoprotein  which  will bind more  hexose than the a1pha - l globulin, \na differentiation between  benign  and malignant  destruction can  often be made; In other words,  jf the \nalpha 1 region is increased in conjunction with an increase in the alpha - I glycoprotein, the  possibility \nof malignancy  must be  ruled  out. \n \nC-Complement  Proteins  are more sensitive  to inflammation  than the globulin  (beta  globulin) \nthey are a component  of. Therefore , if the C -complement  proteins are normal or decreased,  it is \nreasonable  to suspect that although  inflammation  may be present, the inflammation  is probably not  \nacute. However,  if the C -complement  proteins are increased , acute inflammation  is almost certain and \nwill generally be  confirmed by  a significant  increase in the  gamma globulin.  \n \nAfter reviewing more than 20,000 different blood chemistries using the previously mentioned \ncriteria, A. Furda, Ph.D and his group  of researchers. (The Biochemical Biopsy) classified  abnormal  \ntissue  activity into  the areas indicated be1ow.  After  reviewing several thousand of  these chemistries, \nwe interviewed sever al physicians who used the test and  although the  accuracy was not 100 percent , \nit proved to be high enough to warrant  further investigation when one of the  following  protein \npatterns was present.

They are:  \nAn increased  or high normal alpha 1  glycoprotein  (60 -75 mg percent).  \nAn increased  or high  normal  alpha  I globulin (above  0.30 but, below  0.35). \nAn increased  or high normal  alpha  2 globulin  (above 0.60  but, below  0.95).  \nThe increased  or high normal  values  of these  proteins  are not due to elevated  protein  molecules;  \nbut, are due to an increased  ratio of hexose  to protein  in the molecules.  These  findings  may \nfluctuate  but, they must  be present  simultaneously  to identify  the malignant prone individual . This \npatient  may or may not develop  a frank  neoplasm as they get older. However, after following many \nof these patients over a 10 year period, we concluded that a significant number of the patients did \ndevelop neoplasm, but the number was lower in patients who after being advised they were malignant \nprone, qui t smoking, avoided a highly refined diet, exercised routinely and used stress control \ntechniques.  \n    \nPremalignancy:  This pattern  presents  changes  that are slightly different  in degree  and constancy  \nfrom  those seen  with the patient  who is susceptible  or prone  to malignancy .  The findings \ngenerally do not fluctuate and as time goes o n, they will  become more  apparent (unless treatment \nhas been initia ted and is  successful).  Ultimately (unless treated), the pattern will most often progress  \nto the  criteria seen  with frank malignancy.  These  findings may fluctuate, but they must be present  \nsimultaneously to identify the  patient with  a premalignancy.  \nAlpha  glycoprotein  increased  above  75 mg percent. \nAlpha 1 globulin increased above 0.35.  \nAlpha  2 globulin  increased  above  0.95.  \nIn those cases where this pattern  was observed, treatment frequently allowed the blood values to \nreturn  to a normal level.  \n \nPresence  Of Malignancy:  Irrespective of  whether  the malignancy has  been  identified,  if the \nfollowing  pattern  is present, further investigation is warranted.  This pattern has been seen \nfrequently with patients later identified with a frank malignancy.   \nAlpha  l glycoprotein  increased.  above  l00 mg percent. \nAlpha  1 globulin  increased  above  the reference range. \nAlpha  2 globulin increased above the  reference  range.  \nWhen  these findings  present simultaneously, the doctor should  take further action to  rule out \nmalignancy  (the various CEA tests, acid  phosphatase,  alpha fetoprote in, Anti-Malig nin Antibody \n(AMA), human chorionic  gonadotrophin  and other  tests designed  to identify  malignancy).  The \nlocation of  the malignancy can often be determined  through an examination of  the CPK (CK) or \nLDH (LD)  isoenzymes  which correlate with a destructive process.  The isoenzymes of ALP  more \nclosely relate to inflammation  and although useful  in locating the suspected lesion,  they are not \nreliable as the isoenzymes of  CPK (CK) and LDH (LD).  \n \n ",

To Abscess:  This problem  will generally  produce  a marked  increase \nin the haptoglobin  region  of alpha  2 globulin  with a normal  or slightly  increased  alpha  1 globulin. \nLocation  of the abscess  can often  be made  by examination  of the CPI(  (CK),  LDH  (LD)  and ALP \nisoenzymes,  \n \nBenign  Tumor  Activity:  Benign tumor  activity  (benign  space  occupying lesion) should \nbe suspected when the following criteria are present:   \nBorderline  increase  of alpha  l globulin.  \nModerate  increase  of alpha  2 globulin.   \nThese changes are due to pressure created by the space occupying lesion (tumor, cyst, etc.), on surrounding tissue.  \nLocalization of the lesion can frequently be made by an assessment  of the CPK (CK),  LDH  (LO) and ALP  \nisoenzymes.  \nTissue Destruction Due To Auto -Immune Processes:  Tissue destruction to due \nautoimmune  problems  is most reliably determined  by review  of the Lipid  electrophoresis.  In an \nautoimmune  problem there is generally a marked increase in the alpha region of the lipid \nelectrophoresis  along  with decreased  or low normal  cholesterol  (beta  region) and  a decreased  or \nlow normal  triglycerides  (pre beta region).

If only the gamma  globulin \nis increased  the problem is most  likely still  in an inflammatory phase  and there is probably  no \nactive  tissue  damage, or  ulceration ( normal  alpha  l globulin)  The presence  of severe  tissue  \ninflammation, tissue damage or ulceration can be confirmed with serum gastrin.  \nLiver  Dysf unction Due to Fatty Changes or Congestion :  Polyclonal patterns in the \ngamma  globulin tracing  combined  with increase  in the slow -moving  liver isoenzyme  of ALP \n(ALP  al), suggests  a fatty  or congested liver.

In many cases, bridging on the  serum protein \nelectrophoresis tracing  between alpha l  and alpha 2 globulin will  also be present.  \nHepatitis:  Hepatitis is  best determined  by the various blood tests used to identify  this \nproblem; howev er, the following  additional information can be  used to track  the progression of \nthe disease.  Generally,  there  will be  a peaking in  the gamma globulin region.  The peak  can be \nused to monitor  progression  of the problem  from  the acute  phase  to either  the chronic  phase  (very \ndangerous) or resolution.  In uncomplicated cases  the gamma  globulin  region  will begin to  \nnormalize  in about  30 days or less depending upon  the supplemental program  used.  However,  if \nthe gamma globulin peak broadens and develops into a polyclonal tracing , a persistence of \ninflammation  is indicated.  Lymphatic  infiltration  in this region  is responsible  for the  change  from \na single peak to the polyclonal peaks.

Sodium helps to maintain slightly acidic urine and is required for maintenance \nof the sodium -potassium pump (adrenal function).  \nRelated Tests:  BUN, creatinine, serum potassium, CO2, serum chloride, calculated osmolality, \nblood lithium, serum uric acid, serum anion gap, urinary sodium and urinary chloride.  \nReference  Range:  135-145 mmol/L.  \nOptimum  Range:  135-142 mmol/L.  \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Below  120 mmol/L  or above  155 mmol/L.  \nCommon  Causes  For Increased  Serum  Sodium  (Hypernatremia):  \nChronic  Renal  Dysfunction:  See the section  of this  manual  covering  BUN  for \nlaboratory changes, supplemental support and diet requirements.  \nDehydration:  Hypernatremia can  occur from loss of water or from sodium retention and \nthe most common reasons are insufficient water intake or diuretic use.  \nWater  Softeners:  Many  water softeners  use sodium  to soften  the water.  \nLess  Common  Causes  For Increased  Serum  Sodium  (Hypernatremia) : Adrenal  cortical \nhyperfunction, diabetes, congestive heart failure, hepatic failure and vomiting.  \nCommon  Causes  For Decreased  Serum  Sodium  (Hyponatremia):  \nAdrenal  Cortical  Hypofunction:  See the section  of this manual  covering  serum  \npotassium for laboratory changes, supplemental support and diet requirements.  \nIncreased Serum Triglycerides:  See dysinsulinism in the section of this manual covering \nserum triglycerides for laboratory changes, supplemental support, and diet requirements.  Note:  \nIncreased serum triglycerides can result in \"pseudohyponatremia\".  With pseudohyponatremia, \nserum sodium is decreased  but the serum is not hypotonic (serum osmolality is normal or even \nincreased). This can occur as the result of triglycerides replacing water in relation to sodium.  \nAnother cause of pseudohyponatremia can be incre ased serum globulins as seen with \nWaldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.  Further information on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia can \nbe found in the section of this manual covering serum protein electrophoresis (SPE).  \nLess  Common  Causes  For Decreased  Serum  Sodium  (Hyponatremia) : Diabetes,  thyroid \nhypofunction, anterior pituitary hypofunction, congestive heart failure, peptic ulcer and diarrhea.

See GGT for the remaining blood chemistry indicators \nand supplemental support.  \nLess Common Causes for Increased  ALP:  Thyroid hyperfunction, excess ingestion of vitamin D, \nrickets, alcoholism, liver dysfunction (ci rrhosis), Gilbert's syndrome, hepatitis and mononucleosis, \ncancer, adrenal hyperfunction, phlebitis, brucellosis, renal dysfunction, pancreatic dysfunction, \nshingles, AIDS, M.S. and active rheumatoid arthritis.  \n \nCommon  Caused  for Decreased  ALP:  \n \nZinc Deficiency:  WBC or RBC zinc decreased, decreased  or low normal total WBC, Zinc \nTaste Test positive. Suspect zinc deficiency when magnesium deficiency is present. The Zinc Taste  \nTest uses a  0.1 percent zinc  sulfate solution.  A small amount is  placed in  the patient's mouth.  If \nthe patient cannot taste the solution within 10 seconds, it is determined the patient is zinc \ninsufficient.  When the total ALP is below the midline of the optimum range and other indications \nof zinc need are present (white spots on finger nails, reduced sense of taste or smell, cuts heal \nslowly, acne, susceptible to colds, flu or infections, prostate hypertrophy , recurring genital  urinary  \ninfections,  macular  degeneration,  etc.), zinc supplementation  Zinc Orotate (ZI) - 1 qid until the \nbiochemical and subjective indications of zinc need are resolved.)  Note:  With zinc anemia and \nzinc supplementation it may take up to 24 months for the ALP to return to the optimal range.  \nProgesterone and Vitamin C  Deficiency:  Several peer reviewed studies have used ALP as \nthe marker for progesterone  and vitamin C deficiency.  If the zinc deficiency  cannot be defined \nvia the ZTT, laboratory, or  clinical indicators, suspect either a  progesterone or  vitamin C need  and \nconsider  Micronized/Bio -identical  Progesterone  Cream  (ZI) and C-1000  (ZI).  \nLess Common Causes Of ALP Decrease:  Thyroid hypofunction, pernicious anemia, protein \nmalnutrition, adrenal hypofunction, certain prescription drugs especially those containing estrogen \nor estrogen in combination with androgens, hypophosphatasia (confirmed with urinary \nphosphoethanolamine) an d HgH deficiency (see IGF -1). \n \nImportant  Considerations  with  an Abnormal  ALP:  \n \nAlthough a  specific blood test (Brucellosis Agglutinins) for brucellosis (undulant fever) is \navailable, total serum ALP will frequently be increased with the total WBC increased, monocytes \nincreased, lymphocytes increased, and neutrophils decreased. IgG, IgM and SGPT/ALT are  also \nfrequently increased.  Irrespective  of a positive Brucellosis Agglutinins test, if the other blood \nindicators are present and the clinical signs are present (cyclic fever, chronic fatigue  and diarrhea  \nin the early  phase),  supplement al support  should  be initiated  as follows : C.G.F.(ZI) 3 tid  and \nImmune Plus (ZI) \u2013 3 bid.  \n \n \n ",

Phos.  \n \nDiscussion:  Children under 18 years of age have a very high level of ALP bone isoenzyme; hence \nthe increased total serum ALP during bone growth.  The increase peaks at puberty and rapidly \ndeclines.  Serum from healthy adults under 50  years of  age usually is  predominantly liver isoenzyme \nwith little or no bone isoenzyme.  Adults over 50 years of age begin to manifest skeletal changes \nthat result in an increased bone isoenzyme.  Men usually have lower levels of bone isoenzyme than \nwomen.  The isoenzymes of ALP are excellent tools for differentiating benign from cancerous liver \nconditions and for identifying liver, bone and bowel disease WITH OR WIT HOUT AN \nINCREASE IN THE TOTAL SERUM ALP.  The various ALP isoenzymes are described below:  \nLiver Isoenzyme a2:  The major ALP liver isoenzyme is a2 and is the  isoenzyme most \nfrequently increased with an increased total serum ALP.  Liver isoenzyme a2 increases in the blood \nearly in liver disease, often before other functional tests reveal abnormal results.  A wide group of \nconditions result in increased liver isoenzyme a2.  They include: hepatitis, ci rrhosis, fatty liver, \ndrug induced  liver disease, biliary  obstruction,  duct stricture, biliary  cirrhosis and liver cancer.  \nLiver disease associated with an increased isoenzyme a2 is frequently associated with abnormal \nvitamin D metabolism with subsequent osteomalacia.  S.O.S. (ZI)  \u2013 3 tid , Phosphatidylcholine \n(ZI), GB Complete  (ZI) and E.N.V./GBLV -HP (ZI) should be considered with an increased ALP \na2 isoenzyme.  \nLiver Isoenzyme al:  This isoenzyme of ALP is also called the \"fast liver\" isoenzyme. ALP \nisoenzyme al  has been identified in cases of metastatic cancer to the liver, viral hepatitis, alcoholic \ncirrhosis  and other liver  diseases.  The data available on  ALP isoenzyme al  suggests it is  strongly \nassociated with metastatic liver cancer.  When ALP isoenzyme al  is increased  with an  increased \nGGTP, alcoholic cirrhosis  of the liver should be ruled out.  See alpha  1 globulin and serum protein \nelectrophoresis for further information on tissue destruction due to neoplasm and GGTP for \ninformation concerning alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.  \n \nBone Isoenzyme:  ALP bone isoenzyme increases with increased osteoblastic activity; \nhence, the increase with bone growth and the healing of fractures.  Increased ALP bone isoenzyme \nis common with Paget's disease, rickets, bone cancer, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, primary \nparathyroid hyperfunction and in some cases of sprue.  As the ALP bone isoenzyme increases, \nurinary hydroxyproline excretion also increases.  This is especially true with primary parathyroid \nhyperfunction, osteoporosis and osteomalacia.  See seru m calcium and PTH for further information \non parathyroid hyperfunction and serum ALP for further information on osteoporosis, osteomalacia \nand Paget's disease.  ",

It is generally increased with \nperforation of the bowel, ulcerative disease of the intestine and sometimes with liver cirrhosis. \nAcute infarction of the intestine will cause an increase of the ALP intestinal isoenzyme.  Large \nerosive or ulcerative lesions in the stomach, duodenum , and other  areas of the small intestine and \ncolon will also cause the ALP intestinal  isoenzyme to increase; hence, the increase seen with peptic \nand duodenal ulcers.  Lesions associated with malabsorption will cause an increase in  the ALP \nintestinal isoenzyme only if there is erosion or ulceration.  Erosion and ulceration will also cause \nthe serum gastrin to increase significantly (Zollinger -Ellison Syndrome).  See serum total protein \nfor further information on digestive inflammation and serum gastrin for further information on \nulcers.  \nPlacental Isoenzyme:  This isoenzyme is  increased normally in pregnancy.  It appears in \nthe first trimester and increases as the pregnancy  progresses.  Infarction  of the placenta in toxemia \nof pregnancy will cause the ALP placental isoenzyme to increase significantly.  Placenta isoenzyme \ncan also be increased with seminoma, choriocarcinoma  and ovarian cancer.  \n \nRegan/Regan -Variant/Nagao/PA:  These  isoenzymes  of ALP are associated  with several \ndifferent types of cancer.  Regan has been associated with lung cancer, colon cancer and ovarian \ncancer.  Regan -Variant has been associated with hepato -cellular  cancer.  Nagao has been associated \nwith metastatic carcinoma of  the pleural surfaces and with  cancer of  the pancreas.  PA has been \nassociated with cancer of the pancreas.  \nImportant  Considerations  with  Abnormal  ALP  Isoenzymes:  \n \nAlthough the blood chemistry findings with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are variable, total \nserum cholesterol and total ALP will frequently  be increased  with a decrease in the ALP intestinal \nisoenzyme, 25 OH vitamin D -3 and a decrease in the lymphocyte percentage. Predisposing factors \ninclude genetic predisposition, toxic element exposure, systemic and/or intestinal parasites, \nbacterial or viral infection, allerg y/sensitivity, exposure to chemicals, environmental toxins, \npollution and other xenobiotics.  After the predisposing factors have been ruled out, the following \nsupplemental support should be considered irrespective  of other  treatment \u2013S.O.S.

If \nthe patient has access to hyperbaric oxygen this is also helpful for most patients.  Note:  In many \ncases the first signs  of MS are reduced  vision and loss of abdominal muscle strength. With M.S. \nBiotin is often helpful but should be discontinued for  seven days before running a thyroid panel \n(it will not  harm the thyroid but, will change the values on the serum test).  ",

A sample  of EGOT  is taken  and the patient  is given  150 mgs of Pyridoxal  5- \nphosphate B6/Bl (ZI) - 1 tid for 10 days. After ten days a serial check of the EGOT is \ncompleted.  If the EGOT  value  increases,  vitamin  B-6 anemia  is assumed.  \n \nAny patient on exogenous estrogen (birth control pills, Premarin, etc.) is a candidate for \nvitamin  B-6 supplementation.  Exogenous  estrogen is known to reduce  systemic stores of vitamin \nB-6, zinc and magnesium.  See the section of this manual covering estrogen for further information . \n \nOxalic acid (the O in SGOT) is produced as a by -product of the breakdown of sex \nhormones in the liver and gonads. Therefore, if no other reason can be determined for a \ndecreased or increased SGOT/AST, gonadal hypofunction or hyperfunction should be \ninvestigated.  \nAngina Pectoris  is often difficult to differentiate from musculoskeletal problems.  With true \nangina pectoris, the pain, shortness of breath, etc. will exacerbate with increased physical activity.  \nAlso, with true angina pectoris, CPK isoenzyme CK:MB  (heart) will frequently be increased but, \nthe CPK isoenzyme CK:MM (muscle) will be normal.  If the pain, discomfort, shortness  of breath,  \netc. increases  while  the patient  is at rest,  pseudo -angina, secondary  to biliary dysfunction, hiatus  \nhernia,  functional or  pathological pulmonary hypertension, diaphragm spasm, rib  fixations, or \nhypochlorhydria,  should be considered. This is  especially true if  the pain, discomfort, etc., occurs \nafter ingesting fried foods or a meal where protein and carbohydrate are consu med together.

It is increased in all common \nforms of liver/biliary dysfunction and is generally increased above SGPT/ALT and SOOT/AST \nwith biliary tree problems (gall bladder, common bile duct, and pancreas),  obstructive disease and \nalcoholism.  \n \nRelated  Tests:  Same  as those  listed  under  SOOT/AST.  \n \nReference  Range:  9-48 U/L \n \nOptimum  Range:  9-30 U/L. \n \nPossible  Panic Range:  Above  100 U/L. \n \nCommon  Causes  for an Increased  GGTP:  \n \nBiliary Obstruction:  GOT, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total serum bilirubin \nare significantly increased; SGPT/ALT and SOOT/AST will be  increased but, not proportionally \nas increased as GOT and serum ALP. Serum amylase increased, serum LDH increased, alpha 2 \nglobulin increased, LDH isoenzyme #3 and #5 will be increased if the obstruction is in the gall \nbladder, LDH isoenzyme #1, #5 and ser um ALP, will be increased if the obstruction is in the \ncommon bile duct.  Haptoglobin and transferrin  (fractions of alpha 2 and beta globulin) will \nconsistently be increased.  Note:  If the GOT is  above 150  U/L in  conjunction  with a total serum \nbilirubin above 2.8 mg/dL, the patient should be immediately examined by a doctor qualified to \ndiagnose and treat biliary obstruction.  Supplemental Support:   B6/Bl (ZI)  - 1 bid,  Magnesium \nGlycerophosphate Tablets (ZI)  - At bedtime to bowel tolerance, GB Complete (ZI) -3 tid, KI \nCaps  (ZI) - 1 daily and C-1000 (ZI) - Begin with 2 tid and increase to bowel tolerance.  After the \npatient is asymptomatic,  ensure they remain on this program at one -half the indicated dose for \nanother 60 days.  Diet: Use the Roadmap To Health diet. Ensure  the patient drinks at least 8 -10 \nfull glasses of pure water each day, lightly steams all fruits and vegetables and eats one serving \n(two cups) daily of raw grated beets covered with the juice of one -half a lemon and two tablespoons \nfull of unprocessed flax  seed oil.  \n \nAlcoholism:  GOT and serum triglycerides significantly increased. SOOT/AST and \nSGPT/ALT increased; however, the GOT will generally be significantly higher than the \nSGPT/ALT and SOOT/AST.  Total serum bilirubin normal to increased, serum uric acid increased, \nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzyme al  increased, plasma and salivary cortisol can be increased \nor decreased depending upon the stage of the alcoholism (frequently cortisol is increased in the \nearly stage and decreased in the late stage).  Liver caffeine c learance is also frequently abnormal.  \nSupplemental Support:  First use a cleanse/detox program  and the Roadmap To Health Diet. \nAfter  continue diet and add Lithium Orotate (ZI)  - 1 qid. If the patient  has adrenal  \nhyperfunction  use AD Hyper  (ZI) - 1 in the a.m. and 2 at noon.  \n \n ",

The liver alters bilirubin to  a form that  is excreted through the bile  or \nby the  kidneys.  Bilirubin is  increased in  and responsible for  the various  types of  jaundice. Bilirubin \nis classified as:  \n \nTotal  Bilirubin - A combination of  direct  and indirect  bilirubin. \nDirect Bilirubin - Post hepatic, water soluble.  \nIndirect  Bilirubin  - Pre hepatic,  water  insoluble.  \n \nMany laboratories report only total bilirubin and although this is  an important diagnostic value, \nwhere possible, the direct and indirect bilirubin should also be obtained.  This will assist in the \ndetermining if  the increased total bilirubin is  pre or post hepatic.  If either the direct or indirect \nhas been  reported,  the missing  value  can be ascertained  by subtracting  the given  value from \nthe total serum bilirubin.  \nRelated Tests:  GGT, SGPT/ALT, SOOT/AST, serum ALP and ALP isoenzymes, urinary bile, \nurobilinogen, RBC and indices, serum LDH and LDH isoenzymes.  \nReference  Range:  Total  Bilirubin  - 0-1.9 mg/dL.  \nDirect Bilirubin - 0-0.3 mg/dL. \nIndirect  Bilirubin  - 0.1-1.6 mg/dL.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  Same  as reference  range.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Total  Bilirubin  > 2.6  mg/dL.  \nDirect Bilirubin > 0.8 mg/dL \nIndirect  Bilirubin  > 2.0 mg/dL.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for an Increased  Bilirubin:  \n \nLiver/Biliary  Dysfunction:  See SGPT/ALT  and GGTP.  \n \nSeveral  Types  of Anemia:  See serum  ferritin,  serum  iron and MCV/MCH.  \n \nBiliary  Obstruction:  See SGPT/ALT  and GGTP.

CPK acts in the cell by liberating high energy phosphate from \ncreatine phosphate.  This reaction furnishes energy for muscle contraction and nerve tissue \nfunction.  CPK is found primarily in skeletal muscle, brain and myocardial tissue; therefore, \ndamage to any of these tissues will result in an increased  serum CPK.  Since CPK is released from \nthe source tissue primarily during the destructive  process, inflammatory  processes without tissue \ndamage will cause a minimal increase in the total serum CPK or specific  CPK  isoenzymes.  \nAny patient  with  a significant increase in  total serum CPK is  a candidate for a CPK isoenzyme \nstudy.  \n \nRelated Tests:  CPK isoenzymes, serum ALP and ALP isoenzymes, serum LDH and LDH \nisoenzymes, SGPT/ALT, SGOT/AST, GGTP, WBC and differential, serum protein electrophoresis \n(SPE), serum and urinary creatinine, urinary ketosteroids , serum phosphorus,  total serum \ncholesterol, serum triglycerides, serum uric acid and ceruloplasmin.  \n \nReference Range:  22-198 U/L.  Females will normally have levels 20 -25 percent less than males, \ninfants (up to one year of age) may have levels up to two times the adult range and total serum CPK \nwill frequently be moderately increased during pregnancy. CPK can increase after moderate -\nintensity exercise and with some patients on statin drugs (rhabdomyolysis).  \n \nOptimum  Range:   30-180 U/L \n \nPossible Panic Range:  > 250 U/L (Complete the isoenzymes if there is no known cause for the \nincrease.  \nCommon  Cause  for an Increase  in Total  CK/CPK:  \n \nMuscular Dystrophy:  Both total CPK and the CPK Muscle Isoenzyme will be  increased, \nSGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST are generally increased, total serum LDH normal to increased, urinary \ncreatinine decreased, urinary ketosteroids  decreased, serum  creatinine norm al to decreased. \nSupplemental Support:  This is  an extremely difficult metabolic problem, one  that does not \nfrequently respond to supplemental and/or homeopathic therapy.

Cells in these categories are:  \n \nGranulocytes:  Polymorphonuclear  Neutrophils  (Segmented  and Bands).  \nEosinophils.  \nBasophils.  \n \nNon-Granulocytes:  Lymphocytes  \nMonocytes  \n \nGranulocytes originate in the bone marrow.  Monocytes (Non -Granulocyte)  also originate in  the \nbone marrow.  Lymphocytes originate from lymphoblasts in the spleen, lymph glands, tonsils, \nthymus, intestine and possibly the bone marrow and appendix. An increase or decrease in the  total \nnumber of white blood cells is the result of an increase or decrease in one or more of the above \nfractions; therefore, it is essential that a differential count be taken in addition to the total white \nblood count to ascertain where the increase or de crease is located.  The total WBC is a valuable \ntool in screening the system's defense mechanism against infection (virus, bacterial, fungal and \nparasitic) and inflammation. A significant ly increased or decreased total WBC is justification to \nconduct further immune testing (T and B lymphocyte subset assay, immunoglobulins, C -reactive \nprotein, etc.).  \n \nRelated Tests:  WBC differential, serum albumin, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), T  and B \ncell assay, C -reactive protein, RBC and indices, sedimentation rate, viral or bacterial cultures, \ncomprehensive stool and digestive analysis (CSDA).  \n \nReference Range:  4.0-10.5xl0E3/uL Note:  Any stressful situation that leads to an increase in \nepinephrine production can  cause an  increase in  the total WBC.  In infants and  young children the \nWBC count from different sources (capillary versus venous versus arterial) should not be \nconsidered equivalent.  Also,  in the evaluation of  infection in  infants and children, several counts \nshould be  taken from the  same source as  crying infants  and children will often show  leukocytosis \nwith the differential falsely indica ting a bacterial infection.  \n \nOptimum Range:  4500 -8,000 xl0E3/uL.

Gamma globulin and amylase are increased with mumps.  This is  the \npattern commonly found; however, because of increases and decreases in  other WBC fractions \n(eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, etc.), the findi ngs relative to the WBC differential are variable.  \nSupplemental Support:  Immune Plus (ZI) - 3 tid, Olive  Leaf (ZI)  - 1 bid, Viral  Hp (ZI) - 5 drops \ntid and Calcium Orotate  (ZI) - 1 daily, increase with fever greater than 101 degrees. If the child is coughing \nuse Tiny Tots Cough Syrup (ZI) . After the child is asymptomatic continue with Immune Plus  (ZI) - 1 \ndaily and Olive Leaf  (ZI) - 2 tid.

Note:  \nConsultation with a doctor  trained to  treat  childhood diseases should be  considered as  bed rest  and \nquarantine may be required.  With mumps bed rest is  essential as  the incidence of orchitis and pancreatitis \nincreases with excess activity.  \nActive Viral Or Bacterial Infection:  Sedimentation rate increased, total serum globulin \nincreased (the gamma globulin increases with inflammation and the alpha 1 and/or alpha 2 globulin \nwill increase with tissue destruction and/or inflammation), C -complement increased, lymphocytes \ndecreased with  the neutrophils increased, LDH Isoenzyme #1 increased, C -reactive protein \nincreased, monocytes will increase during the recovery phase and band cells will be increased in \nthe active phase.  Note:  Band cells are an excellent means of differentiating active from chronic \ninfection; they will increase in the active phase and normalize i n the chronic or recovery phase.  \nSupplemental Support:  Use the following alone or with antibiotic therapy (if indicated) \nirrespective of the  type of infection;  Oregano Oil Caps  (ZI) \u2013 3 tid,  Immune Plus(ZI)  - 3 tid, \nOlive Leaf (ZI) - 2 tid, C 1000 (ZI) - 2 bid, increase to bowel tolerance .

B cells \nbecome  antibody -producing  cells.  The combined  activity  of the  T and  B cells provides immunity  \nagainst infectious agents, foreign tissue and oncogenic  agents.

Transferrin  is responsible  for 50 \nto 70 percent  of the iron  binding capacity  of the serum.  Since  other  proteins  bind iron, transferrin  \nis not the same as  TIBC.  TIBC and transferrin  are useful in the  differential  diagnosis of anemia, \nespecially  with iron anemia  where the MCV  is decreased.  TIBC  and transferrin levels increase \nwith iron deficiency and decrease with iron overload.  The combination of decreased serum iron, \nincreased TIBC or transferrin and decreased serum ferritin supports the finding of iron deficiency \nanemia.  This pattern is also associated with gastrointestinal bleeding from ulceration or ulceration \ndue to neoplasm.  \nRelated  Tests:  Same  as those  listed  under  serum  iron. \n \nReference  Range:  Use the reference  range  provided  by the laboratory.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  Same  as reference  range.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Any value  30 percent  above  or below  the reference  range.  \n \nCommon  Causes  For An Increased  TIBC:  \n \nIron  Anemia:  See the section  of this manual  covering  serum  iron for laboratory  \npatterns, supplemental support and diet requirements.  \nMicroscopic Internal Bleeding:  See the section of  this manual covering the reticulocyte \ncount for laboratory patterns, supplemental support, and diet requirements.

    "text": " \n148 \n SERUM  FERRITIN  \n \nDiscussion:  Ferritin  is the second most abundant  iron-bearing  protein in the body, surpassed only  \nby hemoglobin.  It is found intracellular  as cytoplasmic  granules and microscopically visible  \nconglomerates called hemosiderin.  Ferritin functions as  an iron storage depot in  the liver, spleen, \nand bone marrow. In the blood stream it plays a role in the regulation of hepatic transferrin \nsynthesis. Circulating ferritin levels appear to reflect the distribution of iron between the \nreticuloendothelial system (RES) cells and blood cell s. Three factors generally determine serum \nferritin levels:  \n1. The iron  content  of the body  tissues.  \n2. The rate of ferritin  dispersal  from the  tissues.  \n3. The rate  of ferritin  extraction  from  the blood.  \nAberrations in the latter two regulatory processes are present in many free radical diseases (cancer,  \nrheumatoid  arthritis, etc.).  In these conditions,  serum ferritin  may not reflect  overall iron storage; \nhowever, in the normal individual, serum ferritin correlates well with tissue iron stores (adequate, \ninadequate, or excessive).  \n \nRelated  Tests:  Same  as those  listed  under  serum  iron. \n \nReference  Range:  Female:  13-150 ng/mL  \nMale:  30-400 ng/mL  \n \nOptimum  Range:  Males:  30-190 ng/mL.  \nFemales:  Before  menopause  - 20-110 ng/mL. \nAfter menopause -20-200 ng/mL.  \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Below  8 ng/mL  or above  500 ng/mL.  Note:  Serum  ferritin  levels  in \nhemochromatosis are commonly increased above 500 ng/mL.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for an Increased  Serum  Ferritin:  \n \nIron Overload/Hemochromatosis:  Hematocrit (HCT) normal, hemoglobin (HGB) nor\u00ad \nmal, serum iron frequently increased above 220 ng/mL, TIBC decreased, liver enzymes and serum \nbilirubin increased with liver involvement, percent of transferrin saturation increased  above 50 \npercent, blood lead sometimes increased, serum vitamin E decreased, and serum triglycerides \nincreased. Diet:  Use only bottled water for drinking and cooking (no well water or city water), \navoid food high in iron such as red meat, organ meats, spinach, soybeans, wheat,  com, and leaf \nlettuce.  Avoid food supplements that enhance iron uptake such as ascorbic acid, fructose, citric \nacid and citrus containing foods, lysine, histidine, cysteine and methionine. Increase foods that \ninhibit iron uptake such as foods containing oxalic acid (except spina ch), foods high in fiber and \nphytate containing foods (except wheat).

Note:  Iron overload  and/or  hemochromatosis  are often  \nsilent (no symptoms) and can result in liver cirrhosis, bacterial infections, dementia, \narteriosclerosis, diabetes, bronzing of the skin, arthritis, and stroke.  If iron overload or \nhemochromatosis is suspected, a health care professional qualified to treat either of these problems \nshould be consulted. Further, if the percent of saturation remains at over 50 percent  after \nsupplemental/dietary support gene testing should be initiated to differentiate iron overload from \nhemochromatosis  (2 genes or more positiv e indicates hemochromatosis and requires that all first -\ndegree relatives also be tested).  \n \nOther Common Causes for an Increased Serum Ferritin:  HIV infection, inflammation, \nhepatitis, several types  of cancer, alcoholism, several inherited anemias (thalassemia, sickle cell, \netc.), hepatic disease, renal disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and acne (increased serum iron \nwith decreased serum zinc). As previously stated under Percent of Saturation, Percent of \nSaturation above 50 percent is the \"gold standard test\" for iron overload and \nhemochromatosis  however, if the serum ferritin is above 500, hemochromatosis  should be \nruled out, even with a normal serum iron or  percent of  saturation below 50 percent . \n \nCommon  Causes  for Decreased  Serum  Ferritin:  \n \nIron  Deficiency  Anemia:  See serum  iron. \n \nOther Common Causes for Decreased Serum Ferritin:  Several types of cancer, intestinal \ninflammation/ulceration  and protein deficiency.

The \nT-3 uptake test in  an indirect measure of thyroid binding globulin (TBG) which measures the \nunsaturated binding sites  on the thyroid proteins.  The use of  T-3 uptake is  limited to  testing with \ntotal thyroxine (T -4) to calculate the free thyroxine index (FTI). T -3 uptake is not as reliable as \ntotal or free T -3 since major illnesses, high doses of salicylates and cortisone and the use of heroin \nand other drugs may alter the TBG which in tum alters the T -3 uptake. Note:  Most authorities have \nabandoned T -3 uptake in favor of free or total T -3 which are more accurate measurements of the \nserum triiodothyronine (T -3) level.  Contraindications:  T-3 uptake cannot be completed after \nadministrat ion of therapeutic or diagnostic radioactive material.  \nRelated Tests:  Serum triiodothyronine (free or total T -3), serum thyroxine (free or total T -4), free  \nthyroxine index  (FTI),  thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),  thyroid binding globulin (TBG), \nantithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti -TPO), thyroid antibodies, serum triglycerides, serum \ncholesterol, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, RBC magnesium, serum albumin, HCT, HGB, \ncortisol and serum gastrin.  Note:  In any case of unresponsive  thyroid hypofunction  (common) \nor thyroid hyperfunction (not  common) anti -TPO and  anti-thyroglobulin  ab, should be  completed \nto rule out Hashimoto's. Anti -TPO and anti -thyroglobulin ab should be completed prior to and \nduring pregnancy, because if increased either can cause fetal abnormality.  \nReference  Range:  24-39 percent  of uptake  \n \nOptimum  Range:  27-39 percent  of uptake.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Below  20 percent  of uptake  or above 41 percent  of uptake.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for an Increased  T-3 Uptake:  \nThyroid  Hyperfunction:  T-4 normal to increased, TSH decreased generally below 0.450, \nserum albumin decreased, TBG increased, serum calcium normal to decreased, serum gastrin \nincreased, HGB  and HCT  decreased,  RBC  magnesium decreased, serum  triglycerides and \ncholesterol normal to  decreased, bone isoenzyme of  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased, anti\u00ad \nTPO infrequently increased, serum ferritin increased and serum glucose frequently increased. TSH \nis the best single serum test for determining thyroid hyperfunction therefore, supplemental support  \nand diet requirements  for thyroid  hyperfunction  are located  under TSH.  \nUse of Thyroxine  and Desiccated  Thyroid  Preparations:  T-3 uptake will  normally  be \nincreased with the use of exogenous thyroxine.  \n \nUse of Triiodothyronine:  T-3 uptake will normally be increased with the use of exogenous \ntriiodothyronine preparations.  \nLess  Common  Causes  For an Increased  T-3 Uptake:  Renal  dysfunction,  heavy  doses \nof salicylates, protein malnutrition, major diseases (especially those involving the liver) and in \ncases where a hereditary change in TBG is present.

If the TSH is decreased below 2.5, but greater than 0.5 and \nsymptoms are present, thyroid hypofunction secondary to anterior pituitary hypofunction is \nprobable.  Other changes that are commonly present are serum albumin increased, serum gastrin \ndecreased, serum calcium increased, RBC magnesium increased, LDH increased in about 60 \npercent of the patients, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decreased, serum triglycerides and  cholesterol \nnormal to increased with the triglycerides frequently quantitatively higher than cholesterol. TSH \nis the best single serum test for determining primary thyroid hypofunction and hypofunction \nsecondary to anterior pituitary hypofunction therefore, su pplemental support and diet requirements \nfor thyroid hypofunction are located under TSH.  \n \nUse Of Exogenous  Estradiol  Containing  Compounds  (Premarin,  Birth  Control  Pills):  \nIn addition to changes frequently present with the use of exogenous estradiol (ALP decreased, \nLDH increased, SOOT often decreased due  to a vitamin B -6 need,  etc.),  the following changes will \nfrequently be  present:  T-3 uptake will be  decreased with a  normal or  increased T -4 and a normal \nfree thyroxine index. Supplemental Support:  Exogenous estradiol generally decreases systemic \nstores of vitamin B -6, magnesium and their synergists.  To ameliorate these insufficiencies \nMagnesium Orotate (ZI), KI Caps (ZI), DIM Complex (ZI),  B6/Bl (ZI) and SunFlax Complex \n(ZI) should be used.  Diet:  Avoid soy, commercially raised chicken and other foods known to \npromote or increase systemic estradiol levels.  \nLess  Common  Causes for a Decreased  T-3 Uptake:  Pregnancy,  use of several  prescribed  and \nillicit drugs and prescribed therapy used to correct thyroid hyperfunction.  \n \nImportant  Considerations  with  an Abnormal  T-3 Uptake:  \n \nThe patient's average axillary temperature (underarm) will frequently be below  97.8 with \nthyroid hypofunction, or thyroid hypofunction secondary to hypofunction of the anterior pituitary.  \nThe axillary temperature should be  taken  for 10 minutes  before leaving bed  and ideally should be \ntaken for five days in a row and averaged.  The test is considered to be invalid if the patient expends \nany energy  prior to taking the axillary temperature. Reduced axillary  temperature is also common \nwith adrenal dysfunction, thiamine deficiency, diets that are low in essential fatty acids and protein \nmalnutrition. Note:  Correct supplemental and/or hormonal support will generally resolve the \nsubjective indications associated with primary or secondary thyroid hypofunction however, the \naxillary temperature will not always increase to  a level much above 97.8.  Slightly low axillary \ntemperature can be  a normal finding for many healthy people. Low axillary temperature is often \nalso found with other, endocrine hypofunction.  \nDifficulty losing weight, reduced initiative, fatigue, sensitivity to  cold, dry,  or scaly skin, \nringing in  the ears, low blood pressure,  impaired hearing, constipation, an  inability to  work under \npressure, loss of the outside portion of the eyebrows, facial edema (myxedema), muscle cramps \nwhile at rest, headaches in the morning that wear off during the day, red hair, left handedness, and \ndepression are all excellent clinical indications of thyroid hypofunction.

However, the major reason is  \ntrauma (physical or psychological)  sometime in  the patient's recent past.  Supplemental support \nwill sometimes normalize the thyroid function, however if there is no change in 40 days or less, \nmedical intervention is required.  \n \nThe following is a list of substances, xenobiotics, etc., that will alter thyroid function. This \nlist will help to answer the question of why there are so many patients with thyroid dysfunction:  \n \nThyroid hormones  undergo  enterohepatic circulation therefore, any  gut, or hepatic \nproblem causing dysbiosis could easily alter thyroid hormone reabsorption or \nelimination.  \nDilantin  and tegretol  can both decrease  T-3 and T-4 production.  \nLithium is  converted by  the thyroid and  inhibits  the formation and  release of \nthyroid hormones.  \nIodine  containing  drugs  (there  are several)  will alter thyroid  function.  \nChloride, bromine and  fluoride  (halogens) act  as inhibitors  of thyroid peroxidase \n(TPO) and thyroid iodide organification.  \nAntidepressants  cause  an inhibition  of TPO.  \nRed dye #3 increases  reverse T -3 and decreases  T-3. \nPCB  and PBB  are known  to cause an  increase  in anti-TPO.  \nPhythalate  esters and metabolites found in water polluted from coal cause a \ndecrease in  thyroid hormone production (is  it the goiter belt  or the coal belt?). \nPyridines from the conversion of coal and cigarette smoke.  \nSelenium  deficiency  resulting  in under -conversion  ofT-4 to T-3. \nAn out of control stress  response which  causes  an increase in  cortisol and a \ndecrease in the conversion of T -4 to T -3. \nThe use of bromine  as a commercial  dough  conditioner  and in hotel  hot tubs.  \n \nThe above  are only  a small  number  of the  reasons  we see so many  patients  with thyroid  hyper \nand hypofunction.  \nThyroxine  (T-4) to triiodothyronine (T -3) conversion:  One of the most overlooked and \nperhaps most important considerations  in the treatment of thyroid hypofunction is  T-4 to T-3 \nconversion.  It is important to note where the T -3 level falls within the laboratory or metabolic \nrange and where the T -4 falls within the laboratory  or metabolic range.  Frequently  you will find \na decreased or low normal T -3 with a normal or increased T -4.

Approximately one -third of T -4 is converted to active T -3, 10 -18 percent is converted to \nReverse T -3 and the remainder is converted to a sulfate form or T -3 and T -3 thyroacetic acid. Both \nare inactive until they are acted upon by the gut f lora and returned to  active T -3; hence the \nimportance  of healthy gut flora with primary  or secondary  thyroid  hypofunction.  T-3 has a higher \nbiological activity than T -4 and will bind to protein (thyroid binding globulin, transthyretin, and \nalbumin) less efficiently  than T -4. T-3 and T -4 exist in the serum  in both bound and free forms. \nFree T -3: Less than 0.5 percent of the total T -3 is in the free form.  Free forms are regulated by \nfeedback systems and appear to parallel rates of cellular uptake.  As the serum concentrations  of \nthe binding proteins increase, the total T -3 also increases, while the free T -3 generally remains the \nsame. Therefore, free T -3 and TSH are  the best  tests to help determine the functional status of the \nthyroid. Reverse T -3 is an inactive form of T -3 that can now be measured by most laboratories.  \nReverse T -3 is frequently caused by the result of increased cortisol production by the adrenal \ncortex.  In this situation, total serum T -3, free T -3 and T -3 uptake will frequently be normal; \nhowever, symptoms of  thyroid hypofunction will generally be present. T -3 supplementation may \nbe helpful in ameliorating the patient's subjective complaints; but the correction for the problem is \ngenerally through therapy directed at decreasing cortisol levels.

It is transported  through \nthe blood bound to thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), prealbumin and albumin.  Alterations in \nbinding capacity or the quantity of TBG may increase or decrease total T -4 without causing \nsymptoms.  T-4 secretion is stimulated  by thyroid  stimulating  hormone  (TSH).  Free T -4 is a \nvery small portion of total thyroxine (generally less than 0.04 percent); however, it is the \nmetabolically  active fraction.  The development  of free T -4 was initiated because total T -4 and \nthe free thyroxine index (FTI) failed to reliably reflect the patient's thyroid status with euthyroid \nsick syndrome.

The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin -\nreleasing  hormone (TRH) that acts  on the anterior pituitary to  release TSH, which in\u00ad tum \nstimulates the  thyroid gland to  release T -3 and T -4. T-3 and T-4 then suppress the  release of TSH \nby means of a negative feedback mechanism.  Simply stated, with normal thyroid and anterior \npituitary/hypothalamus function, a reduction of T -3 and T -4 causes an increase in TSH and an \nincrease in  T-3 and T -4 causes a decrease in  TSH.  The TSH assay was  originally used to confirm \nor rule out prima ry thyroid hypofunction;  however, the new sensitive TSH (sTSH) assays permit \nrecognition of  thyroid hyperfunction as well.  Sensitive TSH (sTSH) has become the best single \ntest for determining thyroid hypo and hyperfunction.  \n \nRelated  Tests:  T-3 Uptake, free or total  triiodothyronine (T -3), free  or total  thyroxine  (T-4), \nfree thyroxine index (FTI), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), antithyroid peroxidase antibody \n(Anti -TPO), thyroglobulin antibodies, TSH antibodies, serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, \nthyrotropin -releasing hormone (TRH), serum calcium, serum pho sphorus, serum potassium, serum \nsodium, RBC or serum magnesium, HCT, HGB, serum albumin, serum gastrin, salivary, urinary \nor plasma cortisol, luteinizing  hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),  serum estradiol \n(E2), serum or 24 hour urine samples  for estrogens (El, E2 and E3), renin, prolactin, progesterone, \nhuman growth hormone (use IGF -1 to make determination), DHEA, urinary ketosteroids, serum \nand free testosterone and serum or plasma aldosterone.  \n \nReference  Range:  .450-4.50 ulU/L  \n \nOptimum Range:  If the patient exhibits the subjective indications of thyroid hypofunction and the \nsTSH is between 0.5 and 2.5 ulU/L thyroid hypofunction secondary to anterior pituitary \nhypofunction should be considered first. If the patient exhibits the subjective indica tions of thyroid \nhypofunction and the  sTSH is greater than 2.5 mlU/L, but below 4.50, sub -acute thyroid \nhypofunction  should  be considered  first. In other  words,  if sTSH  is below  2.5 and the symptoms  \nare present,  first support  the anterior  pituitary  function.  If sTSH  is above  2.5 and  the \nsymptoms  are present,  first support  the thyroid  function.   If the sTSH  is below  \n0.450 ulU /L, thyroid hyperfunction must be ruled out and if the sTSH is above 4.50 ulU/L \nprimary thyroid  hypofunction  probably  present.  The subjective  indications  of thyroid hypo \nand hyperfunction are  listed under important considerations  with an abnormal T -3 uptake.  Note:  \nBy itself (without symptoms) sTSH is only valuable when the values are below 0.450 ulU/L \n(thyroid hyperfunction) or above 4.50 ulU/L (thyroid hypofunction).  \n \nPossible Panic Range:  Below 0.3 ulU/L or above 20.0 ulU/L. Note: sTSH will often be \nreduced below 0.3 in the presence of thyroid hormone replacement.  When below 0.3 Reverse \nT-3 should be checked.  If the thyroid hormone replacement  is excessive the Reverse T -3 will \nbe increased if  not, the hormone replacement is being correctly applied.  ",

Diet:  Use the Roadmap To Health  diet, cook,  \ndrink  and bathe  only with pure water  (drink  at least  8-10 full glasses  a day) and avoid foods  in \nthe cabbage family and  millet.  Note:  If the patient does  not respond  to supplemental support  \nin 45 days or less, rule-out Hashimoto's and  consider referring  the patient for hormonal \nreplacement.  \n \nLess Common Causes for an Increased Thyroid Stimulating Hormone:  Liver dysfunction, \nsevere debilitating illness, dopamine therapy, anterior pituitary tumor (usually benign), HIV \ninfection, pre -eclampsia, toxic and non -toxic goiter, increased prolactin, and breast cancer.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for a Decreased  Thyroid  Stimulating  Hormone:  \n \nThyroid Hyperfunction:  The sTSH  will almost always be  decreased below 0.450  ulU/L. \nSee T -3 uptake for other laboratory changes.  Supplemental Support:  Immune Plus (ZI)  \u2013 4 \ntid, Lithium Orotate (ZI) - 1 qid, Zinc  Orotate (ZI) - 1 qid , C.G.F. (ZI) - 3 tid and SunFlax \nComplex (ZI)  - 2 tid. Iodine (Kl Caps  (ZI) can also be considered however it should be used \nwith care.  Iodine can help with most cases of thyroid hyperfunction but can also exacerbate the \nproblem with a small minority. Complete an iodine excretion test to ascertain the need for iodine.  \nDiet:  Use the Roadmap To Health diet and increase foods in  the cabbage family and millet. \nEnsure the  patient  drinks at  least 8 -10 full glasses of pure water each day.

    "text": " \n162 \n ANTITHYROID  PEROXIDASE  ANTIBODY  \nAnti -TPO,  Thyroperoxidase,  TPO -Ab, Thyroid  Antimicrosomal  Antibody  \n \nDiscussion:  TPO  is the major  antigen  in the antigen -dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity \nassociated  with thyroid  disease.  Chronic  autoimmune  thyroiditis  may be subclinical  or may be \npresent  with normal  thyroid  values  (frequent),  hypothyroidism  (frequent)  or hyperthyroidism \n(infrequent) and/or toxic or nontoxic  goiter.  Thyroid antibodies include thyroglobulin antibodies \nand anti-TPO.  The measurement  of anti-TPO  is the most  sensitive  test for the diagnosis  of \nautoimmune thyroiditis and frequently negates the requirement to  complete other antibody tests. \nAbout 60 percent of the patients with diffuse goiter have antithyroid  antibodies, while about 95 \npercent have TPO antibodies. Although the peer literature does not reflect this, the treatment  of \nautoimmune  thyroiditis  with iodine  is effective  in 90 percent  of the cases.  Irrespective  of the \nusefulness of  iodine with thyroiditis, it  should not  be used until iodine need is  demonstrated  with \na urine  iodine  excretion  test. The patient  should  be monitored  closely  to ensure  iodine  \nsupplementation is  not exacerbating the problem and the desired result is being achieved. Note:  \nThe incidence  of Hashimoto\u2019s  in the U.S.  population  is growing,  and the use of iodine  is \nnot, therefore  it makes  little  sense  to indicate,  irrespective  of the peer  literature,  that \nHashimoto's is caused by increased iodine use.  \nRelated  Tests:  Same  as those  listed  under  T-3 Uptake.  \n \nReference  Range:  Use laboratory  range.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  Use laboratory  range.  \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Values  increased  to more  than twice  the reference  range.  \n \nCommon  Cause  For An Increased  Anti -TPO:  \nAutoimmune Thyroiditis:  An increase in anti -TPO can be present with both normal \nthyroid function, thyroid hyperfunction and thyroid hypofunction. However, the increase is almost \nalways seen with hypofunction and normal thyroid values.  See T -3 uptake for other laboratory \nchanges normally associated with thyroid hyper and hypofunction.  In addition to the supplemental  \nsupport indicated under TSH for thyroid hypofunction  and thyroid hyperfunction, if the anti -TPO  \nis increased,  add Selenomethionine (ZI)  - 1 daily  D3-5000  (ZI)  1 bid,  Olive Leaf (ZI)  1 tid, \nImmune Plus (ZI)  2 tid, 8X Pancreatin  (ZI) \u2013 1 qid on an empty stomach and vitamin E as \ndirected by the manufacture . Irrespective  of the thyroid function normal, hyper or hypo, when an \nincreased anti -TPO is present, virus, toxic element exposure, toxicity from inoculations, \ninflammation from allergy (especially gluten) and/or yeast problems must be ruled out as  nexus \nto the increased anti -TPO.  Physical examination as  well as radiographic studies if  needed should \nbe conducted to ensure  there are no space occupying lesion(s) causing the increased anti -TPO. The \nliterature indicates a need to restrict iodine intake however, clinically we have found that iodine \nsupplementation  is useful in more than 90 percent of the cases.  If iodine supplementation is  \nconsidered use  KI Caps  (ZI) - 1 per day and discontinue Selenomethionine  as each KI Caps  (ZI) \ncontains 200 mcg of Selenomethionine . If iodine increases the Anti -TPO discontinue it \nimmediately.  ",

Upon release from these cells, the hormone is  absorbed into \nthe blood stream and carried to the fundic cells causing them to release hydrochloric acid.  In \naddition to stimulating HCl secretion, gastrin evokes the secretion of pepsin and the intrinsic factor \nin the stomach, increases antral motility, stimulates enzyme secretion by the pancreas and increases \nbile flow from the liver.  Therefore, increased gastrin levels are associated with hyperchlorhydria \nand decreased gastrin levels are associated with hypochlorhydria and  subsequent pancreati c and \nbiliary insufficiency.  \nRelated Tests:  GGTP, SGPT/ALT, SGOT/AST, total serum globulin, serum phosphorus, serum \nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) and ALP isoenzymes, HGB, HCT, RBC, MCV and MCH, serum or \nurinary methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, serum chloride, potassium and CO2, serum iron, \nserum fe rritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) or transferrin, serum protein electrophoresis \n(SPE), comprehensive stool and digestive analysis (CSDA), BUN, reticulocyte count and \nhelicobacter pylori (H. pylori).  \nReference  Range:  Fasting:  up to 100 pg/mL.  \n \nOptimum  Range:  45-90 pg/mL.  < 45 pg/mL  is a \"silver  bullet\"  for hypochlorhydria.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Above  100 pg/mL  and below  150 pg/mL  = possible  gastric  ulcer.  \nAbove  150 pg/mL  and below  200 pg/mL  = possible  peptic  ulcer.  \nZollinger -Ellison Syndrome above 200 pg/mL. Levels up to 3000 \npg/mL are not uncommon. Note:  Up to 25 percent of the patients with Zollinger -Ellison Syndrome \n(serum gastrin above 200)  also have  multiple endocrine neoplasm (pituitary, pancreas, adrenal), \nand up to 60 percent of the positive Zollinger -Ellison Syndrome patients will test positively for \ngastric cancer.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for an Increased  Serum  Gastrin:  \nGastric Ulcer:  SGOT/AST increased, if intestinal bleeding is present TIBC and transferrin  \nwill be increased,  serum  iron and serum ferritin will  be normal  to decreased,  HGB and HCT will \nbe normal to decreased and the reticulocyte count will be increased.  MCV and MCH will be \nincreased due to vitamin B -12 and folic acid deficiency, serum albumin decreased, gamma globulin \nwill be increased, the haptoglobin region of alpha 2 globulin will be decreased, ALP intestinal \nisoenzyme will be increased and if active tissue damage or ulceration is present, alpha 1 globulin \nwill be increased.  Note:  If only the gamma globulin fraction is increased, and the alpha 1 globulin \nfraction is still within the normal range, the problem is probably still inflammatory, with no active \ntissue damage or ulceration.

In our experience the most useful tests to determine adrenal cortical function are  urine,  \nsaliva, or  a fasting a.m.  serum  sample. Dexamethasone  suppression tests  assist in distinguishing \nthe reason for increased cortisol levels. Dexamethasone  is a synthetic steroid that will suppress \nACTH secretion.  After administration, decreased cortisol levels will be  present if the feedback  \nmechanism  from the pituitary/hypothalamus is intact.  This generally rules out Cushing's \nsyndrome.

Testosterone  is synthesized in the interstitial cells of Leydig in \nthe testicles.  Testosterone exists in both free (40 percent) and bound (60 percent) to albumin and \nto sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).  Free testosterone is the active form.  Usual testosterone \nassays measure both the free and bound forms.  With certain problems, total testosterone  can be \nnormal while free testosterone  is increased  or decreased. Controversy  exists in the healing mis \nconcerning the most effective way to measure testosterone (free or total). However, most clinicians \nwill complete both tests and use the fol lowing to dete rmine bioavailable testosterone: Albumin -\nBound Testosterone (approximately 40 percent of the Total Testosterone) Plus Free \nTestosterone = Bioavailable Testosterone).

At the present time, the significance of  \nthe concentrations  of these fractions in  non-pregnant urine is  not well established. However, the \nfollowing formula (originated by He nry Lemon, M.D.) devised from quantitative totals for these \nthree fractions has proven useful in many  cases to help to determine the predisposition  to or \npresence of feminizing tumors.  The quantitative levels of E 1, E2 and E3 are obtained from 24 -hour \nurine or dried spot urine (Dutch test) and if the patient is still having menstrual  cycles, the urine \nshould  be collected  between day 19 and day 23 of their cycle (day  1 of the cycle being the first \nday of menstrual bleeding).  \nEstriol [E3]  divided by (estrone [El]  plus estradiol [E2]). \nIf the result is above 1.0 the risk is low.  \nIf the result is  between 0.8  and 1.0 the risk  is moderate. \nIf the result is below 0.8 the risk is increased.  \n \nWhen the result is below 0.8 DIM Complex  (ZI) 2 bid, Chrysin (ZI) \u2013 3 bid and KI Caps  \n(ZI) - 1 daily, Bio-Identical  USP Micronized  Estrogen  Cream  (Z) - \u00bd to 1 full pump  bid \n(product contains  only estriol  [E-3] and no estradiol) are often effective  in increasing  the ratio to \n1.0 or higher.  \nIt is an accepted scientific fact that exogenous synthetic estrogen  (Premarin, birth  control \npills, etc.), decreases systemic stores of vitamin B -6, zinc and magnesium and tends to alter thyroid \nfunction (T -3 uptake decreased, T -4 increased). If present the following should be considered for \nany patient on  exogenous synthetic estrogen and for one year after the estrogen is discontinued. \nUse C.G.F.

Also, PSA can be within the normal \nrange even  with advanced prostate cancer.  PSA increases the  rate of detection of  prostate cancer, \nbut some of the cancers it detects are biologically insignificant.  PSA is most accurate when  it is \ncollected  prior  to a digital  rectal  examination,  bicycle riding and/or ejaculation.  PSA is very \nuseful when serial measurements are taken.  When the serial measurements increase (double over \na 3 to 12 months) this  generally indicates prostate cancer is  present.  If the patient is symptom free \nand the PSA (not increasing) is between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, free PSA should be considered.  \nFree PSA to total PSA percent is lower in patients with prostate cancer and is typically above 25 \npercent in patients with BPH.

    "text": " \n195 \n VITAMIN  D-3 \n25-0H Vitamin  D-3 \n \nDiscussion:  Vitamin D -3 is a fat -soluble secosteriod.  It is converted to calcidiol in the liver  \nand part  of the calcidiol is  converted to  calcitrol, the  biologically active form, by the \nkidneys. In humans it functions as a prohormone and can be synthesized from sun exposure.  \nCurrently we  are being warned by many in  the healing aids that even moderate sun exposure \nwill cause skin cancer and sun -blocking agents are required to prevent skin cancer.  For this  \nreason, the  vast majority of  the population is  found to  be below  the range used by most \nlaboratories for 25 -OH vitamin D -3 (the most useful test for measuring vitamin D levels in \nthe body) and for this reason, irrespective of sun exposure, supplemental  vitamin D is \ngenerally needed to maintain adequate serum levels.  \nRelated Tests:  Serum calcium, serum/red blood cell magnesium, serum phosphorus, \nparathyroid hormone (PTH) and blood tests used to determine free radical disease, bone \nproblems, T.B., M.S., alcoholism, infections and a  host of other problems where vitamin D \nhas been found to be below the laboratory range.  \n \nReference  Range:  32-100 ng/mL  \n \nOptimum  Range:  60-110 ng/dL  \n \nCommon  Cause  for Increased  Vitamin  D-3: \n \nHypervitaminosis  D: Check  serum  calcium,  serum/red  blood  cell magnesium \nand PTH.  Ensure the patient is not taking excess levels of supplemental  vitamin D.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for Decreased  Vitamin  D-3: \nVitamin D -3 Anemia:  Supplement with  D-3 5000 (ZI) - 1 bid, or higher as \nindicated by a licensed health care provider/ Always conduct a  serum 25 -OH Vitamin D3 \ntest after the patient has been on high levels of the supplement for 40 days.  \nMultiple  Sclerosis:  See important  considerations  under  alkaline  phosphatase \n1soenzymes.  \nOsteoporosis/Osteomalacia:  See serum  alkaline  phosphatase.  \n \nLess  Common  Causes  for Decreased  Vitamin  D-3: T.B.,  virus,  bacterial  infections, \nfree radical pathology, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, skin and hair \nhealth and although not seen routinely in the free world, rickets.  \n \nImportant  Considerations with Decreased  Vitamin  D-3: With free radical  disease, M.S., \ncardiovascular  disease, infections and neurodegenerative  disease,  the blood level of vitamin \nD-3 should be kept between 85 and 110 ng/dL  \n \nClinical results have shown D3 to be an important component in the treatment of endometriosis.",

    "text": " \n196 \n SEX  HORMONE  BINDING  GLOBULIN  \nSHBG  \n \nDiscussion:  Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is  a glycoprotein that binds to  the two sex \nhormones; androgen and estrogen.  Other steroid hormones such as progesterone, cortisol and other \ncorticosteroids are bound by transcortin.  Testosterone and estradiol circulate in the blood stream \nloosely bound to albumin (approximately 40 percent) and tightly bound to SHBG (approximately \n60 percent). SHBG levels are higher in pre -pubertal children than in adults and with the fat mass \nduring e arly puberty they begin to fall as androgens begi n to rise. A genetic variant of SHBG \n(Asp327>Asn) causes an  increase ofup to 20  percent in individuals that tend to have increase \nSHBG levels.  \n \nRelated  Tests:  Testosterone  (free  and total)  and estrogen.  \n \nReference Range:  The unit  of measurement varies from laboratory to laboratory, however most \nlaboratories  use nmol/L.  The adult range for males using nmol/L  is 10-57 and for adult females \nit is 18 -144. \n \nOptimum  Range:  Use the laboratory  range.  \n \nPossible  Panic  Range:  Any value  more  than 30 percent  above  the reference  range.  \n \nCommon  Causes  for an Increased  SHBG:  \n \nHepatitis  and Other  Hepatic  Dysfunction:   \nSee ALT/SGPT,  GGT,  WBC  and Differential  \n \nToxic Element  Exposure:  Covered  in Toxic Element  Exposure  Document  Created  by \nBalancing Body Chemistry w/Nutrition, LLC from Zorex (800-679-3027 ) \n \nAnorexia:  Covered in  the Balancing Body Chemistry w/Nutrition LLC  Protocol Manual \n(800-679-3027 ). \n \nHyperthyroidism:  See TSH,  T-3 and T-4 \n \nHIV: See WBC  and Differential  and T-Cell Evaluation  \n \nTesticular  Hypofunction:  See Total  and Free Testosterone  and Estrogens  \n \nLess  Common  Causes  for Increased  SHBG:  Alcoholism,  Nontoxic  Goiter,  Thyroid  Nodule, \nAcute Myocardial Infarct, Hypertension.
